## About

This newsletter was originally started by [Jesse Squires](https://github.com/jessesquires), and hosted on his blog at [jessesquires.com](http://www.jessesquires.com). After issue #4, this site was created to provide the newsletter with a proper, dedicated home. All previous issues were [migrated](http://www.jessesquires.com/new-weekly-brief/), and it is now completely open for the community. Currently, [Bas Broek](https://github.com/BasThomas) is leading the project. Contributions are welcomed and encouraged!

Lovingly built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [jQuery](https://jquery.com), and [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). Generously hosted by [GitHub](https://pages.github.com).
