With WWDC coming up in just two and a half weeks time, there is still a lot
going on when it comes to Swift.

### Podcasts

Jesse and JP [discuss](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/295535)
"Removing Things From Swift", talking about implicit returns and eliding commas.

### News and community

[Zhuowei Zhang](https://twitter.com/zhuowei) and [Max Desiatov](https://twitter.com/MaxDesiatov)
worked on [initial support for compiling Swift to WebAssembly](https://swiftwasm.org). ðŸ˜±

### Commits and pull requests

[Raj Barik](https://github.com/rajbarik) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/19820)
with an entire optimizer pass to convert existentials to generic parameters,
creating new opportunities for unboxing and devirtualization.

### Returned proposals

[SE-0258](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0258-property-delegates.md): *Property Delegates* was [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0258-property-delegates/24080).

> There was a lot of great discussion in this review, leading to some very
useful feedback for the Core Team and the proposal authors. That feedback can
be broken down into two categories: (1) procedural feedback about the state of
the proposal and its review and (2) technical feedback about the actual
proposal. Both are useful, and we'll consider each in turn.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0260](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0260-library-evolution.md): *Library Evolution for Stable ABIs* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0260-library-evolution/24260/1).

> One of Swift's goals is to be a good language for libraries with binary
compatibility concerns, such as those shipped as part of Apple's OSs. This
includes giving library authors the flexibility to add to their public
interface, and to change implementation details, without breaking binary
compatibility. At the same time, it's important that library authors be able to
opt out of this flexibility in favor of performance.

[SE-0253](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0253-callable.md): *Callable values of user-defined nominal types* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0253-callable-values-of-user-defined-nominal-types/24177).

> This proposal introduces "statically"
[callable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callable_object) values to Swift.
Callable values are values that define function-like behavior and can be called
using function call syntax. In contrast to dynamically callable values
introduced in
[SE-0216](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0216-dynamic-callable.md),
this feature supports statically declared arities, argument labels, and
parameter types, and is not constrained to primary type declarations.
>
> In a nutshell, values that have a method whose base name is `call` (referred to
as a "`call` method" for the rest of this proposal) can be called like a
function. The function call syntax forwards arguments to the corresponding
`call` method.

{% highlight swift %}
struct Adder {
    var base: Int
    func call(_ x: Int) -> Int {
        return base + x
    }
}

let add3 = Adder(base: 3)
add3(10) // => 13
{% endhighlight %}

### Swift Forums

[Michael Ilseman](https://twitter.com/ilseman/) shared [a case study](https://forums.swift.org/t/omitting-returns-in-string-case-study-of-se-0255/24283) omitting `return`s in `String`.

> Iâ€™m a fan of [Nate Chandler](https://twitter.com/neightchan)â€™s [SE-0255](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0255-omit-return.md) which allows us to omit the `return`
keyword in a single-expression function or computed variables. Here is a case
study of SE-0255 as applied to `String`'s internal implementation.

[Ding Ye](https://github.com/dingobye) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-ispowerof2-to-binaryinteger/24087) to add `isPowerOf2` to `BinaryInteger`.

> Checking some mathematical properties of integers (e.g., parity,
divisibility, etc.) is widely used in scientific and engineering applications.
While Swift's standard library provides a convenient method `isMultiple(of:)` to
test whether an integer is a multiple of another, there are other cases that
are not yet supported. A frequently used one is to check if an integer is power
of two. This pitch would like to address this problem by adding a computed
property `isPowerOf2` to the `BinaryInteger` protocol.

[Giuseppe Lanza](https://twitter.com/GLDeveloper) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-stdlib-making-sorting-algorithm-choosable/24100) to make sorting
algorithms selectable.

> It's currently unclear without peeking under the hood of swift implementation
is the algorithm used for sorting, changes to this algorithm (recently it
passed from introsort to timsort) and performances tradeoffs.
>
> Different sorting algorithms might be preferred depending on the problem
that needs to be solved. In certain cases it's important to know that the
sorting is stable, in other cases might be important to be sure that the
algorithm is in place.

[Igor Kulman](https://twitter.com/igorkulman) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-method-to-sum-numeric-arrays/24170) to add a `sum`-method to numeric arrays.

> I currently sum the arrays using `.reduce(0,+)` which I do not mind by the code
is not that readable

{% highlight swift %}
let total = expenses.map({ $0.amount }).reduce(0,+)
{% endhighlight %}

> Another bigger problem than readability is that I encounter code like this
from other developers all the time:

{% highlight swift %}
var sum = 0
for expense in expenses {
    sum = sum + expense.amount
}
{% endhighlight %}

> This code might come from imperative thinking but it might also come from
not knowing how to use `.reduce()` which can look like an intimidating method.
A `.sum()` would be friendlier and much easier to use even to inexperienced
developers.

[Philipp Heller](https://twitter.com/pxheller) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-protocol-conformance-for-tuples-anonymous-structs/24207) to allow Protocol Conformance for Tuples and Anonymous Structs.

> Currently, if you wish to pass some data to a function that requires the
data to conform to a specific protocol, you have to define some type that
conforms to the protocol and create an object with that type afterward.
>
> Right now tuples cannot be used as literals to construct structs. Assume
there is a function `prettyPrintAsJson(data: Encodable)` that you only need to
call once in your code. You would define a `struct` (or `class`) first and
create an instance of that type afterward.
