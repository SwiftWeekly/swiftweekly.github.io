Welcome to the 50th issue of the weekly! It's hard to believe we've reached this milestone! üòä

This week Ted Kremenek wrote an official post on the [3.1 release process](https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-1-release-process/). Swift 3.1 is intended to be source compatible with Swift 3.0 and set for release in Spring 2017. (Spring for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere. üòâ) The final date to accept major changes for Swift 3.1 will be around January 16, 2017. As Chris Lattner [noted](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/807368728048324608): *"Swift 3.1 is the first release to benefit from the new era of source compatibility, a result of swift-evolution refining and polishing 3.0!"*

**This will be the last issue for 2016.** But don't worry, I'll still be periodically [tweeting](https://twitter.com/swiftlybrief) anything interesting. Swift.org will likely start to quiet down over the coming weeks. If you're in the US, enjoy the holidays and (hopefully) time off. We'll be back in January!

### News and community

The final version of [Xcode 8.2 was released](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12122016a), along with updates for all of Apple's platforms. ([Release notes](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Introduction.html))

Soroush Khanlou wrote a post on [*Guarding Against Long Compiles*](http://khanlou.com/2016/12/guarding-against-long-compiles/). It turns out that it's pretty easy to have Xcode generate warnings for functions that take too long to type-check.

The video for Mike Ash's talk [*Exploring Swift Memory Layout*](https://realm.io/news/goto-mike-ash-exploring-swift-memory-layout/) at GOTO Copenhagen 2016 is now online. As always, Mike does a great job explaining complex topics.

### Twitter

There were some interesting discussions on Twitter this week, so how about a new section in the weekly? üòÑ

Rob Napier [started a thread](https://twitter.com/cocoaphony/status/808402924535762944) on the semantics of `nil` versus the empty string (`""`) when dealing with `String?`.

Nick Lockwood [asked](https://twitter.com/nicklockwood/status/808257898296000512), *What's the collective term for constants and variables in Swift? "properties"?* `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

Ole Begemann [investigated](https://twitter.com/olebegemann/status/808687131543666688) how Swift 3 handles the new emoji in iOS 10.2. Spoiler: it isn't Unicode 9.0 compliant yet. ‚òπÔ∏è

### Commits and pull requests

Slava Pestov ([@slava_pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov)) found [and fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/30c4235193b64050f8110ef5598c7efb4501e0da) a 'horrific' Swift 3 compatibility bug. When they say Swift 3.1 will be compatible with Swift 3, [they're serious](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/809134772786036736). üòÖ

Hugh Bellamy ([@hughbe](https://github.com/hughbe)) continued working on the port to Windows with a number of pull requests:

- Port swift-lldb to Windows, [#105](https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb/pull/105)
- Support building swift/AST with MSVC on Windows, [#5948](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5948)
- Port stdlib/public/stubs/GlobalObjects to Windows, [#6239](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6239)
- Fix errors and warnings building swift/SIL on Windows using MSVC, [#5954](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5954)

Erik Eckstein ([@eeckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein)) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6181) an issue where the compiler would seg fault with `-O` and `-whole-module-optimization`.

Chris Bailey ([@Chris__Bailey](https://twitter.com/Chris__Bailey)) posted the [meeting minutes](https://github.com/swift-server/work-group/pull/58) from the Server APIs work-group HTTP stream meeting.

Karl Weinmeister ([@kweinmeister](https://github.com/kweinmeister)) opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/745) on corelibs-foundation to finish implementing `NSLengthFormatter`.

Michael Ilseman, the [Swift compiler dog](https://speakerdeck.com/ayanonagon/contributing-to-swift?slide=11), ([@Ilseman](https://twitter.com/Ilseman)) cleaned up [the clang importer](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6278) in preparation for dealing with Swift source compatibility.

Doug Gregor ([@dgregor79](https://twitter.com/dgregor79)) fixed [a constraint solver issue](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6294) where after binding a type variable, not all affected constraints would be activated.

### Proposals

No updates this week! Check [the status page](http://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) to see the current state of proposals.

### Mailing lists

Brian King started [a thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20161212/029441.html) on changing `NSObject` dispatch behavior.

> I wanted to follow up to a blog post I wrote about [Message Dispatch in Swift](https://www.raizlabs.com/dev/2016/12/swift-method-dispatch). I mentioned some changes to NSObject that didn‚Äôt result in any objections, so I thought it was time to see what the SE mailing list thought.
>
> I‚Äôve read a few conversations on SE mailing list that have morphed into abstract conversations about dynamic vs static dispatch. I want to focus specifically on how Swift NSObject subclasses behave.
>
> I think that there are 2 changes that will result in fewer bugs and
will not have a substantial impact on performance:
