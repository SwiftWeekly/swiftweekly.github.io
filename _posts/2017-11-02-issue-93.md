It's iPhone X week! Tomorrow, the first customers will receive their new devices.
In other news... the team working on Swift at Apple is [reading our blogs](https://twitter.com/gregheo/status/925119320606236673), so definitely keep up the blogging (or start doing so?!)

Apple also released Xcode 9.1, which includes [fixes for various Swift crashers](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/925548115452497920).

### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 35](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/91842) Jesse and JP talk about performance profiling in Linux - without Instruments.

### News and community

The video of Doug, Slava and John's talk on "Implementing Swift Generics" is now [available](https://twitter.com/modocache/status/925555416351825920).

Apple's Joe Groff and Xi Ge gave talks at [Swift Summit](http://swiftsummit.com) this week, where Joe talked about "Swift's Reflective Underpinnings" and Xi talked about "Creating Refactoring Transformations for Swift". At the same conference, there were also "Open Sourcing Swift" and "Refactoring Transformations" labs run by Apple. So awesome to see Apple engineers attending and speaking at conferences, sharing their knowledge! ðŸ¤“

Video's of JP's and my talk from FrenchKit are available. JP talked about [Profiling Swift Performance on Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWeLLTFjqXg), I gave a talk about [What's up with Swift 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXqZaKodLfA).

Slava shared a gentle reminder of the awesome [`swift-source-compat-suite`](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/924133915199119360), where you can add your open source project to make sure new additions to Swift do not break source compatability.

The first swift evolution proposals ([SE-0075](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0075-import-test.md) and [SE-0186](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0186-remove-ownership-keyword-support-in-protocols.md)) have been implemented in Swift 4.1, so this Swift version has been added to the [status page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) now, [too](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/755).

In Signapore, the government is teaching [seniors to write Swift](https://www.cnet.com/news/singapore-teaches-its-seniors-to-code/) for the Hour of Code.

Slava's fingers are itching to [implement an `Either` type](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/925133908835835904). Soonâ„¢?

Chris Bailey announced [Kitura 2.0](https://developer.ibm.com/swift/2017/10/30/kitura-20/), IBM's web framework for building Swift applications.

Paul Hudson introduced the Swift Community Awards a few weeks ago, and [the shortlist](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/awards) is available. It includes **this very newsletter** as well as its podcast, [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped). That's quite the honor! Thanks for all of you who mentioned us, and feel free to vote and make it even more awesome! ðŸ˜Ž

### Commits and pull requests

Mark Lacey [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12653) that abolishes `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional` (IUOs) completely - in Swift 5. You can test this (and more) in the development toolchain snapshots that Apple is sharing on [Swift.org](https://swift.org/download/). Go test and explore what's coming in future versions of Swift!
It was first (partly) implemented in Swift 3 as part of [SE-0054](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0054-abolish-iuo.md).

Slava Pestov pitched a proposal on cross-module inlining and specialization by opening [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/754) on swift-evolution, which would be another step towards Swift 5's goal of reaching ABI stability.

### Mailing lists

Chris Lattner [shared some thoughts](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171023/040733.html) on Python interop in Swift.

> In short, I think we should build a simple Swift/Python interop story. This sort of thing has be built numerous times for many languages (owing to Pythonâ€™s great support for embed-ability), including things like `PyObjC`, `boost.python`, and many others.
>
> If we do this, the vast majority of the Python ecosystem should be directly usable from within Swift code, and there are only a few major syntactic differences (e.g. ranges work differently). We would add failable inits to the primitive datatypes like `Int`/`String`/etc to convert `Python.Object` values into them, and add the corresponding non-failable conversions from `Python.Object` to those primitives.
>
> Overall, I think it will provide a really nice experience, and allow us to leverage the vast majority of the Python ecosystem directly in Swift code. This project would also have much more narrow impact on the Swift compiler than the ObjC importer (since it works completely differently). For a first cut, I donâ€™t think we would have to worry about Swift classes subclassing Python classes, for example.

### Finally

Joe Groff's human was [very, very prepared](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/925122252479148032) for his talk at Swift Summit.
