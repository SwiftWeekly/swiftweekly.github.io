### Accepted proposals

[SE-0221](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0221-character-properties.md): *Character Properties* was [acceptance status was updated](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modification-se-0221-character-properties/14944/3).

> The core team has resolved to change the status of this proposal to **accepted** with modification, deferring the `.isEmoji` property to a later proposal.
>
> The core team still believe it is a useful feature for the standard library, but needs more investigation that should not hold up the rest of this proposal.
>
> In addition, the proposal will drop the source-breaking change to the existing `FixedWidthInteger.init?`. While this would be the preferred naming for a newly proposed initializer, it doesn't clear the bar for a source-breaking change for Swift 5.

[SE-0228](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0228-fix-expressiblebystringinterpolation.md): *Fix `ExpressibleByStringInterpolation`* was [accepted with a small amendment](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0228-fix-expressible-by-string-interpolation/16548).

> Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and the proposal is accepted with [one small amendment](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/909) to provide a default implementation of `init(stringLiteral:)` for types that conform to `ExpressibleByStringInterpolation`.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0229](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0229-simd.md): *`simd` vectors* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0229-simd-vectors/16518).

> This proposal would expose a common subset of operations on the SIMD types supported by most processors in the standard library. It is based on Apple's `<simd/simd.h>` module, which is used throughout Apple's platforms as the common currency type for fixed-size vectors and matrices. It is not a complete re-implementation; rather it provides the low-level support needed to import any such library, and tries to make a number of things much nicer in Swift than they are in C or C++.

[SE-0230](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0230-flatten-optional-try.md): *Flatten nested optionals resulting from `try?`* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0230-flatten-nested-optionals-resulting-from-try/16570).

> Swift's `try?` statement currently makes it easy to introduce a 
nested optional. Nested optionals are difficult for users to reason
about, and Swift tries to avoid producing them in other common cases.
>
> This document proposes giving `try?` the same optional-flattening
behavior found in other common Swift features, to avoid the common
occurrence of a nested optional.
>
> It's currently quite easy to end up with a nested `Optional` type when 
using `try?`. Although it is valid to construct a nested optional, it
is usually not what the developer intended.
