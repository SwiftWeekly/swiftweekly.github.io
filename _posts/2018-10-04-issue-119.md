### News and community

[Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) has written [an overview](https://swift.org/blog/5-0-release-process/) of the release process of Swift 5.0, including the goals and an estimated schedule.

[Mike Ash](https://twitter.com/mikeash) wrote [a blog post](https://swift.org/blog/how-mirror-works/) on the Swift.org blog, explaining how `Mirror` works.

[Timac](https://twitter.com/timacfr) wrote [a blog post](https://blog.timac.org/2018/0924-state-of-swift-ios12/) that measures Apple's use of Swift in iOS 12. 66 binaries are now using Swift! 🎉

[Bruno Rocha](https://twitter.com/rockthebruno) wrote [a blog post](https://swiftrocks.com/how-caseiterable-works-internally-in-swift.html) on how Swift 4.2's `CaseIterable` works internally.

### Commits and pull requests

[Lily Vulcano](https://twitter.com/millenomi) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/1708) that merges improvements from the Core Foundation version found in Mojave and iOS 12 into Swift Foundation.

[Albert Aleksieiev](https://twitter.com/albert_keyj) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/609) that adds Android support to SwiftNIO! 💪

[Michael Gottesman](https://twitter.com/gottesmang) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/19690) bringing performance improvements to the standard library. 🏎

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0221](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0221-character-properties.md): *Character Properties* was [accepted with modifications](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modification-se-0221-character-properties/14944/3).

> The core team has resolved to change the status of this proposal to **accepted** with modification, deferring the `.isEmoji` property to a later proposal.
>
> The core team still believe it is a useful feature for the standard library, but needs more investigation that should not hold up the rest of this proposal.
>
> In addition, the proposal will drop the source-breaking change to the existing `FixedWidthInteger.init?`. While this would be the preferred naming for a newly proposed initializer, it doesn't clear the bar for a source-breaking change for Swift 5.

[SE-0228](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0228-fix-expressiblebystringinterpolation.md): *Fix `ExpressibleByStringInterpolation`* was [accepted with a small amendment](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0228-fix-expressible-by-string-interpolation/16548).

> Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and the proposal is accepted with [one small amendment](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/909) to provide a default implementation of `init(stringLiteral:)` for types that conform to `ExpressibleByStringInterpolation`.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0229](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0229-simd.md): *`simd` vectors* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0229-simd-vectors/16518).

> This proposal would expose a common subset of operations on the SIMD types supported by most processors in the standard library. It is based on Apple's `<simd/simd.h>` module, which is used throughout Apple's platforms as the common currency type for fixed-size vectors and matrices. It is not a complete re-implementation; rather it provides the low-level support needed to import any such library, and tries to make a number of things much nicer in Swift than they are in C or C++.

[SE-0230](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0230-flatten-optional-try.md): *Flatten nested optionals resulting from `try?`* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0230-flatten-nested-optionals-resulting-from-try/16570).

> Swift's `try?` statement currently makes it easy to introduce a 
nested optional. Nested optionals are difficult for users to reason
about, and Swift tries to avoid producing them in other common cases.
>
> This document proposes giving `try?` the same optional-flattening
behavior found in other common Swift features, to avoid the common
occurrence of a nested optional.
>
> It's currently quite easy to end up with a nested `Optional` type when 
using `try?`. Although it is valid to construct a nested optional, it
is usually not what the developer intended.

### Swift Forums

Alejandro Alonso pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/default-implementation-in-protocols/15794) to make it easier to have default implementations in protocols, without the need of an extension.

> I've been working on implementing Default Implementation in Protocols and I have a working early implementation of the feature.
>
> What this feature allows is that you can now declare a default implementation of a requirement from the protocol:

{% highlight swift %}
protocol Animal {
  func makeNoise() {
    print("Bark!")
  }
}

struct Dog: Animal {}

let sparky = Dog()
sparky.makeNoise() // Bark!
{% endhighlight %}

Peter Camb shared [an issue](https://forums.swift.org/t/anyobject-parameter-cannot-assign-to-immutable-expression/16642), which is a bug in Swift that can currently not be solved through Swift iself.

> I'm hitting this issue in my NSOpenSavePanelDelegate in a Sandboxed Mac app.
>
> I need to get a reference to the sender as a Panel and set the directory.

{% highlight swift %}
/* NSSavePanel/NSOpenPanel: Gets and sets the directoryURL shown. */
@available(OSX 10.6, *)
open var directoryURL: URL?
{% endhighlight %}

> All of my `as?` casts fail because the Sandbox uses a private subclass for these items.

[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN):

> This is a longstanding bug, but it looks like we don't have a JIRA bug for it. [..] it's very similar to SR-5475 (which is about optional properties of protocols). I don't think we have a good workaround other than defining a little static inline function in Objective-C that will do the call for you without trying to check anything.

{% highlight objc %}
NS_SWIFT_NAME(setDirectoryURL(_:for:))
static inline void setDirectoryURLForPanel(id panel, NSURL * _Nonnull url) {
  NSSavePanel *realPanel = (NSSavePanel *)panel;
  realPanel.directoryURL = url;
}
{% endhighlight %}

> An alternate approach in this specific case would be to file a bug against Apple that the sender here is not an instance of `NSOpenPanel` or at least `NSSavePanel`.

### Finally

Making all sorts of progress [on variadic generics](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/1044802613345218563). 🦄
