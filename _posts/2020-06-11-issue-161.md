The [previous issue](/issue-160) has a more extensive introduction, so for this one
I'll keep it short. WWDC is coming up really soon ‚Äî I'm very much looking
forward to it and seeing/meeting people online. Come say hi if possible :-)

### News and community

[Tom Doron](https://twitter.com/TomerDoron) wrote [a blog post and announced](https://swift.org/blog/aws-lambda-runtime/)
Swift AWS Lambda Runtime, designed to help Swift developers build serverless
functions for the Amazon Web Services Lambda platform.

[Fabian Fett](https://twitter.com/fabianfett) wrote [a blog post](https://fabianfett.de/getting-started-with-swift-aws-lambda-runtime)
on getting started with Swift on AWS Lambda.

[Daniel Dunbar](https://twitter.com/daniel_dunbar) announced [llbuild2](https://forums.swift.org/t/llbuild2/36896),
an experimental, Swift native, fully async, NIO futures-based low level build
system. Started as the `cevobuild` experiment in `llbuild`, it aims to continue
that exploration.

[Ben Cohen](https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift/status/1264664397504372736) played
around [with `Collection`](https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift/status/1264664397504372736),
implementing an `EitherCollection` that is a whopping 774x faster than
`AnyCollection`.

> We've got a "rule of three" so when we get asked the same question three
times, we need to do something to document it and today was at least the third
time I personally got asked the "looping over futures" question.

I love this rule.

### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/32223)
for multi-statement closure type inference. The supported statements are
currently limited, but will improve over time. üèé

### Proposals in review

[SE-0282](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0282-atomics.md): *Interoperability with the C Atomic Operations Library ‚öõÔ∏é* is [under a second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0282-review-2-interoperability-with-the-c-atomic-operations-library/37360).

> This proposal adopts a C/C++-style weak concurrency memory model in Swift,
describing how Swift code interoperates with concurrency primitives imported
from C.
>
> This enables intrepid library authors to start building concurrency constructs
in (mostly) pure Swift.

This proposal includes [a proof-of-concept package](https://github.com/apple/swift-se-0282-experimental)
demonstrating the use of atomics from C to provide a low-level atomic API to
Swift.

### Swift Forums

[Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-package-registry-service/37219)
for a Swift package registry service.

> Swift Package Manager downloads dependencies using Git. Our proposal defines
a standard web service interface that it can use to also download dependencies
from package registries.
>
> Today, a package dependency is specified by a URL for a Git repository. When
a project is built for the first time, Swift Package Manager clones the
repository for each dependency and attempts to resolve the version requirements
with the available tags.

[Patrick Weigel](https://forums.swift.org/u/patricktheprogrammer/summary) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/replace-the-reference-types-weak-and-unowned-with-nonstrong/36740)
to replace the reference types `weak` and `unowned` with `nonstrong`.

> In Swift it is possible to create strong reference cycles between class
instances. Strong reference cycles are bad as they create potentially crashing
memory leaks (unused memory that is not made available to the app). Swift
provides two ways to resolve strong reference cycles: weak references and
unowned references. Swift requires the coder to determine which type (`weak` or
`unowned`) to use, when in many instances the coder simply wants the type to be
not strong.

[Dave Abrahams](https://twitter.com/DaveAbrahams/status/1215792568039927808) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-non-public-conformances-implementing-public-api/37159)
to allow non-public conformances to implement public API.

> In Swift, protocol extensions provide a beautiful way to share API
implementations across value types. For example, an extension on the
`Equatable` protocol provides a public implementation of the `!=` operator to
all public conforming types. The power of this feature is limited, however,
because the conformance can never be less visible than APIs provided by
extensions depending on that conformance.

[Denys Shabalin](https://forums.swift.org/u/shabalin/summary) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/automatic-requirement-satisfaction-in-plain-swift/37158)
for Automatic Requirement Satisfaction in plain Swift.

> Swift can automatically generate code to satisfy the requirements of special
protocols such as `Equatable`, `Hashable` and `Codable`. For example, any
`struct` whose stored properties conform to Equatable can itself conform simply
by declaring it so, without explicitly implementing `Equatable`'s requirement
for a `static func ==(Self, Self) -> Bool`:

```swift
struct Point: Equatable { 
    var x: Float
    var y: Float
}
```

> The implementation of `==` for `Point` is synthesized by the compiler behind
the scenes.
>
> This functionality is extremely convenient, but it is currently limited to
the few protocols for which the compiler defines automatic requirement
satisfaction. We would like to lift this restriction and allow for arbitrary
libraries to vend protocols and automatic conformances.

[Dave Abrahams](https://twitter.com/DaveAbrahams/status/1215792568039927808) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/an-implementation-model-for-rational-protocol-conformance-behavior/37171)
for an Implementation Model for Rational Protocol Conformance Behavior.

> When Swift implementers are faced with questions about the intended
programming model for generics, they commonly respond with a focus on how
generics are implemented, which, as the latter discussion shows, is not always
compatible with the intended semantics. Furthermore, it makes a poor foundation
for user (and especially my) understanding.
