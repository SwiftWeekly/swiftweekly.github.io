A lot of new hardware to talk and think about from Tuesday's Apple Event.
And a lot of new software to look forward to — which includes a whole lot of
the features the Swift team has been working on. I'm very much looking forward
to the new software in particular, and the app updates it will bring.

### News and community

The Gradle team [announced](https://blog.gradle.org/introducing-the-swift-plugins)
Swift support to compile, link and install applications and libraries, C++
interoperability, dependency management and more.

[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN) shared [a document](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/CToSwiftNameTranslation.md)
explaining name translation from C to Swift.

### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27033)
that directly leads to the elimination of over 400 lines of code from the
compiler. 🎉

[Johannes Weiss](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/1130)
enabling the thread sanitizer for SwiftNIO, now that it works well enough on
Linux, thanks to [Julian Lettner](https://github.com/yln).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0263](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0263-string-uninitialized-initializer.md): *Add a String Initializer with Access to Uninitialized Storage* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0263-add-a-string-initializer-with-access-to-uninitialized-storage/27417).

> This proposal suggests a new initializer for `String` that provides access to
a String's uninitialized storage buffer.
>
> `String` today is well-suited to interoperability with raw memory buffers when
a contiguous buffer is already available, such as when dealing with `malloc`ed
C strings. However, there are quite a few situations where no such buffer is
available, requiring a temporary one to be allocated and copied into. One
example is bridging `NSString` to `String`, which currently uses standard
library internals to get good performance when using `CFStringGetBytes`.
Another, also from the standard library, is `Int` and `Float`, which currently
create temporary stack buffers and do extra copying. We expect libraries like
SwiftNIO will also find this useful for dealing with streaming data.

### Swift Forums

Davide Mendolia pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/generic-covariance-to-improve-api-usage/28719) 
to introduce generalized Generic Coveriance.

> As far as I know, only Arrays support Generic Covariance. Is it possible to
generalize it or to introduce in core elements like `Result` and allow libraries
like Combine to use it?

{% highlight swift %}
class Base {
}
class Derived: Base {
}

class ArrayBase {
    func foo(x: [Derived]) -> [Base] { return x }
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Would allow simplification of the following code instead of throwing errors
and require casting. Somethings that's already done today for `Optional`s and
`Array`.

{% highlight swift %}
class JustBase {
    func foo(x: Just<Derived>) -> Just<Base> { return x } // Compiler Error: Cannot convert return expression of type 'Just<Derived>' to return type 'Just<Base>'
}

class ResultBase {
    func foo(x: Result<Derived, Error>) -> Result<Base, Error> { return x } // Compiler Error: Cannot convert return expression of type 'Result<Derived, Error>' to return type 'Result<Base, Error>'
}
{% endhighlight %}

[Richard Wei](https://twitter.com/rxwei) shared [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-mega-proposal/28547)
for Differentiable Programming.

> We have completed a comprehensive proposal for the differentiable programming
feature we’ve been incubating over the last 1.5 years. We’ve gone over many
iterations on the feature design, and have partially completed the
implementation. Now we are ready to start a discussion on Swift Evolution,
specifically on upstreaming and standardizing the feature.
>
> Since this proposal is overly long (\~60 pages), we hope to start by merging
it into the `docs/` directory via [this pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27034),
and draft bite-sized proposals that contain references to the mega-proposal.

You can find the full proposal [here](https://github.com/dan-zheng/swift/blob/differentiable-programming/docs/DifferentiableProgramming.md).

[Gwynne Raskind](https://twitter.com/_AngeloidBeta)
pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/yet-another-varargs-splat-proposal/28649)
to support varargs "splat".

> Forwarding variadic arguments has come up fairly often in discussion, and I
thought I'd try my hand at working up a proposal, with a focus on arguments
against the oft-proposed "prefix operator" syntax.

You can find the full proposal [here](https://github.com/gwynne/swift-evolution/blob/splat-proposal/proposals/NNNN-forward-array-to-variadic-args.md).

[Owen Voorhees](https://twitter.com/owenvoorhees) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-extended-error-messages/28754)
to extend the capabilities of error messages.

> As a follow up from [Future of Diagnostics UX](https://forums.swift.org/t/future-of-diagnostics-ux/28178)
a couple weeks back, I wanted to further explore the idea of "extended
diagnostic messages" and see if they would be a good fit for Swift. What follows
is a rough pitch for what that might look like. I'm not sure if this will/should
result in an evolution proposal, but I think writing this up using the pitch
format makes it easy to evaluate and discuss alternatives.
>
> I'm interested in any and all feedback people have on whether they'd find
this useful! I'm especially interested in hearing from anyone who has worked
with Rust/Elm in the past and can comment on the benefits & drawbacks of their
approaches to diagnostics.

[Johannes Weiss](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss) shared [meeting notes](https://forums.swift.org/t/august-11th-2019/28553)
from the Swift on the Server Working Group that took place on August 8.

### Finally

[I know, I know...](https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1171794533140463617)
Still a good joke in my books.
