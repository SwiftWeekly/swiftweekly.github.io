With the [ServerSide.swift](https://www.serversideswift.info) conference having
taken place for the second year, there are a lot of exciting updates on Swift
on the server — and more!

### Podcasts

In the latest Swift Unwrapped episode, Jesse and JP talk about the [new Swift
Compiler Driver](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/311779) project.

### News and community

The Swift for Tensorflow team wrote [an extensive manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/DifferentiableProgramming.md)
on differentiable programming in Swift.

[Tanner Nelson](https://twitter.com/tanner0101/) wrote [a blog post](https://swift.org/blog/sswg-update/)
with an update on the progress in the Swift Server Work Group over the last year.

[Andrea Scuderi](https://twitter.com/andreascuderi13) wrote [a blog post](https://medium.com/better-programming/whats-new-in-server-side-swift-3834e70d2281)
on ServerSide.swift.

[Cory Benfield](https://twitter.com/Lukasaoz) shared [some contributions](https://twitter.com/Lukasaoz/status/1189835893106003969)
to the SwiftNIO project from a workshop at ServerSide.swift.

### Commits and pull requests

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r) merged [two](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28035) pull
[requests](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/2397) that
simplify the bootstrap script for the Swift Package manager.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0267](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0267-where-on-contextually-generic.md): *`where` clauses on contextually generic declarations* was [accepted with a modification](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0267-where-clauses-on-contextually-generic-declarations/30051/49).

> The core team has decided to accept this proposal with one modification. The
proposal addresses the issue of conditional protocol requirements by disallowing
constraints involving `Self` from being applied to protocol requirements, but it
should also do so for non-`final` class methods, to avoid the same problem with
conditional dynamically-dispatched methods in classes.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0269](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0269-implicit-self-explicit-capture.md): *Increase availability of implicit `self` in `@escaping` closures when reference cycles are unlikely to occur* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0269-increase-availability-of-implicit-self-in-escaping-closures-when-reference-cycles-are-unlikely-to-occur/30376).

> Modify the rule that all uses of `self` in escaping closures must be explicit
by allowing for implicit uses of `self` in situations where the user has already
made their intent explicit, or where strong reference cycles are otherwise
unlikely to occur. There are two situations covered by this proposal. The first
is when the user has explicitly captured `self` in the closure's capture list,
so that the following would compile without error:

```swift
class Test {
    var x = 0
    func execute(_ work: @escaping () -> Void) {
        work()
    }
    func method() {
        execute { [self] in
            x += 1
        }
    }
}
```

> Secondly, this proposal would make implicit `self` available in escaping
closures when `self` is a value type, so that the following would become valid:

```swift
struct Test {
    var x = 0
    func execute(_ work: @escaping () -> Void) {
        work()
    }
    func method() {
        execute { 
            x += 1
        }
    }
}
```

### Swift Forums

[Kaitlin Mahar](https://twitter.com/k__mahar) shared [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/officially-supported-mongodb-driver/30324)
to officially support the MongoDB Driver for Swift on the server.

> We’re currently working on adding an asynchronous SwiftNIO-based version of
our API to meet the SSWG incubation process minimal requirements. This is still
in the design phase, and we’d love to hear feedback from the community on what
we’ve come up with so far.
>
> **Current State and Future Plans**
> We initially developed MongoSwift about 18 months ago with a synchronous API
for use with the mobile/embedded version of MongoDB. However, we’ve increasingly
shifted our focus toward providing a great server-side experience. We did work
over the summer to implement automatic connection pooling in the driver and are
now tackling the crucial asynchronous API.
>
> The driver complies with nearly all of the MongoDB driver
[specifications](https://www.github.com/mongodb/specifications), which are
documents our team writes detailing everything from what a driver’s CRUD API
should look like to how it should select which server to send a command to.
These specs ensure consistent experiences using MongoDB across languages, while
still allowing room for implementations and public APIs to vary in
language-appropriate ways.

[Owen Voorhees](https://twitter.com/owenvoorhees) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/multi-pattern-and-conditionally-compiled-catch-clauses/30246)
to add multi-pattern and conditionally compiled `catch` clauses.

> Currently, each `catch` clause in a `do`-`catch` statement may only contain a
single pattern and where clause, and may not be conditionally compiled using a
`#if` directive. This is inconsistent with the behavior of cases in switch
statements which provide similar functionality. It also makes some error
handling patterns awkward to express. This proposal extends the grammar of
`catch` clauses to support `#if` and a comma-separated list of patterns (with
optional `where` clauses), resolving this inconsistency.

[Bryan Clark](https://twitter.com/clarkbw) asked [for ideas and concerns](https://forums.swift.org/t/github-swift-package-management-service/30406)
on how the GitHub package registry will work with the Swift Package Manager.

> Our goal is to present a package management service specification which could
be implemented by anyone, not only GitHub. This spec will include necessary API
endpoints, package naming (URL spec), versioning system, and other elements
required or in addition to the basics. We plan to open source our implementation
(written in Go) such that others can contribute back to it and progress can be
made in the open.

[Gwen Mittertreiner](https://github.com/gmittert) has been working on [adding support for Windows in the
Swift Package Manager](https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-support-for-windows-as-a-platform/30158).

> I've been making progress on Windows support for SPM, and one of the things
I'd like to add now is adding Windows as a supported platform in the Package
Description.

[Paul Fechner](https://github.com/GottaGetSwifty) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pre-pitch-codable-customization-using-propertywrappers/30244)
on `Codable` customization using Property Wrappers.

> Currently the only method of adding custom Encoding/Decoding for `Codable`
Types (without a custom implementation) is by adding options to the
`Encoder`/`Decoder`. Although this is relatively fleshed out in
`JSON`(`En`/`De`)`Coder`, there are still some major pain points.
>
> 1. Options must be set for every (`En`/`De`)`coder` used
> 2. The option Types are separate so e.g. `dateEncodingStrategy` and
`dateDecodingStrategy` have separate implementations and are both required to
handle full serialization.
> 3. The options aren't Portable and each (en/de)coder must supply their own
options. Not even Swift's own `PropertyList`(`En`/`De`)`coder` has support for
the same options as it's JSON cousin.
> 4. It's all or nothing. E.g. If a Type or it's children need to use more than
a single `dateEncodingStrategy` they must manage it themselves.

### Finally

You have lacking documentation, and you have [awesome documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/DifferentiableProgramming.md#calculus-is-fun).
(yes, the [banner](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string) here
is amazing, too.)
