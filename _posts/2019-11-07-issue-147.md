simplify the bootstrap script for the Swift Package manager.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0267](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0267-where-on-contextually-generic.md): *`where` clauses on contextually generic declarations* was [accepted with a modification](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0267-where-clauses-on-contextually-generic-declarations/30051/49).

> The core team has decided to accept this proposal with one modification. The
proposal addresses the issue of conditional protocol requirements by disallowing
constraints involving `Self` from being applied to protocol requirements, but it
should also do so for non-`final` class methods, to avoid the same problem with
conditional dynamically-dispatched methods in classes.

## Returned proposals

[SE-0265](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0265-offset-indexing-and-slicing.md): *Offset-Based Access to Indices, Elements, and Slices* was [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0265-offset-based-access-to-indices-elements-and-slices/30503).

> Swift's indexing model is based on solid concepts that have held up well over
the years, but the verbosity of expressing positions at integer offsets from
known indices has been a persistent pain point. The Core Team feels that this
is a significant problem and is very happy to see a proposal aimed squarely at
it.
>
> `OffsetBound` allows the expression of abstract indices that aren't actually
valid in a collection. During the review, it was pointed out that, rather than
responding to this by clamping or reporting an error, we could use it to
improve expressivity: for example, if the user inserts something at `.last + 5`,
we could pad out to that index with some (user-provided) padding element. The
Core Team discussed this idea and ultimately decided to reject it. We feel that
it provides a simpler and more consistent programming experience overall if
abstract indices can always be thought of simply as sugar for computing a
specific valid index.
>
> It was also pointed out that anchoring abstract indices at the beginning and
end of a collection is fairly limiting; there are plenty of other interesting
ways of deriving indices, like finding the first index that matches a predicate.
The Core Team feels that it should not be a goal of this feature to totally
replace the need to work with concrete index values. In particular, this
shouldn't become an arbitrarily-complex expression-template language.
>
> That said, it's important that abstract indices compose nicely with concrete
indices. Programmers should feel like they can reliably use abstract indices
anywhere they could use concrete indices. That doesn't appear to be true of the
current proposal: in particular, programmers can slice between two abstract
indices or between two concrete indices, but not between a mix of either. The
Core Team feels it's important to avoid this kind of inconsistent-feeling
experience.
>
> Along the same vein, abstract indices can only be anchored relative to the
start and end of a collection. It is frequently useful to be able to anchor
relative to a concrete index, e.g. to slice from an index returned by
`firstIndex(where:)` to the fifth element past that. This pattern is not
addressed by the current proposal, and it's not clear whether the proposal can
be extended this way in the future.
>
> If necessary, the Core Team is willing to consider new language support for
slicing subscripts, either through new syntax or through new interpretations of
existing syntax.
>
> The proposal author also requested an opportunity to revise the proposal's
treatment of certain methods on `RangeReplaceableCollection`.
>
> Accordingly, SE-0265 is returned for revision.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0269](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0269-implicit-self-explicit-capture.md): *Increase availability of implicit `self` in `@escaping` closures when reference cycles are unlikely to occur* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0269-increase-availability-of-implicit-self-in-escaping-closures-when-reference-cycles-are-unlikely-to-occur/30376).

> Modify the rule that all uses of `self` in escaping closures must be explicit
by allowing for implicit uses of `self` in situations where the user has already
made their intent explicit, or where strong reference cycles are otherwise
unlikely to occur. There are two situations covered by this proposal. The first
is when the user has explicitly captured `self` in the closure's capture list,
so that the following would compile without error:

```swift
class Test {
    var x = 0
    func execute(_ work: @escaping () -> Void) {
        work()
    }
    func method() {
        execute { [self] in
            x += 1
        }
    }
}
```

> Secondly, this proposal would make implicit `self` available in escaping
closures when `self` is a value type, so that the following would become valid:

```swift
struct Test {
    var x = 0
    func execute(_ work: @escaping () -> Void) {
        work()
    }
    func method() {
        execute { 
            x += 1
        }
    }
}
```

### Swift Forums

[Kaitlin Mahar](https://twitter.com/k__mahar) shared [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/officially-supported-mongodb-driver/30324)
to officially support the MongoDB Driver for Swift on the server.

> We’re currently working on adding an asynchronous SwiftNIO-based version of
our API to meet the SSWG incubation process minimal requirements. This is still
in the design phase, and we’d love to hear feedback from the community on what
we’ve come up with so far.
>
> **Current State and Future Plans**
> We initially developed MongoSwift about 18 months ago with a synchronous API
for use with the mobile/embedded version of MongoDB. However, we’ve increasingly
shifted our focus toward providing a great server-side experience. We did work
over the summer to implement automatic connection pooling in the driver and are
now tackling the crucial asynchronous API.
>
> The driver complies with nearly all of the MongoDB driver
[specifications](https://www.github.com/mongodb/specifications), which are
documents our team writes detailing everything from what a driver’s CRUD API
should look like to how it should select which server to send a command to.
These specs ensure consistent experiences using MongoDB across languages, while
still allowing room for implementations and public APIs to vary in
language-appropriate ways.

[Owen Voorhees](https://twitter.com/owenvoorhees) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/multi-pattern-and-conditionally-compiled-catch-clauses/30246)
to add multi-pattern and conditionally compiled `catch` clauses.

> Currently, each `catch` clause in a `do`-`catch` statement may only contain a
single pattern and where clause, and may not be conditionally compiled using a
`#if` directive. This is inconsistent with the behavior of cases in switch
statements which provide similar functionality. It also makes some error
handling patterns awkward to express. This proposal extends the grammar of
`catch` clauses to support `#if` and a comma-separated list of patterns (with
optional `where` clauses), resolving this inconsistency.

[Bryan Clark](https://twitter.com/clarkbw) asked [for ideas and concerns](https://forums.swift.org/t/github-swift-package-management-service/30406)
on how the GitHub package registry will work with the Swift Package Manager.

> Our goal is to present a package management service specification which could
be implemented by anyone, not only GitHub. This spec will include necessary API
endpoints, package naming (URL spec), versioning system, and other elements
required or in addition to the basics. We plan to open source our implementation
(written in Go) such that others can contribute back to it and progress can be
made in the open.

[Gwen Mittertreiner](https://github.com/gmittert) has been working on [adding support for Windows in the
Swift Package Manager](https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-support-for-windows-as-a-platform/30158).

> I've been making progress on Windows support for SPM, and one of the things
I'd like to add now is adding Windows as a supported platform in the Package
Description.

[Paul Fechner](https://github.com/GottaGetSwifty) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pre-pitch-codable-customization-using-propertywrappers/30244)
on `Codable` customization using Property Wrappers.

> Currently the only method of adding custom Encoding/Decoding for `Codable`
Types (without a custom implementation) is by adding options to the
`Encoder`/`Decoder`. Although this is relatively fleshed out in
`JSON`(`En`/`De`)`Coder`, there are still some major pain points.
>
> 1. Options must be set for every (`En`/`De`)`coder` used
> 2. The option Types are separate so e.g. `dateEncodingStrategy` and
`dateDecodingStrategy` have separate implementations and are both required to
handle full serialization.
> 3. The options aren't Portable and each (en/de)coder must supply their own
options. Not even Swift's own `PropertyList`(`En`/`De`)`coder` has support for
the same options as it's JSON cousin.
> 4. It's all or nothing. E.g. If a Type or it's children need to use more than
a single `dateEncodingStrategy` they must manage it themselves.

### Finally

You have lacking documentation, and you have [awesome documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/DifferentiableProgramming.md#calculus-is-fun).
(yes, the [banner](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string) here
is amazing, too.)
