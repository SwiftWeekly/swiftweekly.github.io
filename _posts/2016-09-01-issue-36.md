It's almost that time of the year again when [Apple will reveal new iPhone models](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2016/). Invitations were sent to the press earlier this week for an event on September 7 &mdash; less than a week away! This likely means a final (or at least GM) release of Xcode 8 and the other platforms, and thus a final (or GM) release of Swift 3.

For me, this is least attractive aspect of Swift &mdash; being tied to the release cycles of Xcode, Apple's platforms, and hardware. Along with [radar](http://bugreport.apple.com), these deadlines (and thus the *real deadline* for Swift 3) present a closed door to the open source community. I think these things could eventually be detrimental to the health of the project, but let's see how the Swift 4 development cycle goes first! In any case, I think we're all excited and ready for Swift 3 to be finished! ðŸ˜„

### Starter tasks

- [SR-2451](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2451): [Compiler] Wording for labels in function types suggests that specific label cannot be used
- [SR-2442](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2442): [Compiler] Need better diagnostics for multi-value assignment with missing parentheses
- [SR-2409](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2409): [Compiler] Diagnostic refers to "Objective-C module" even on Linux

### Commits and pull requests

Tim Bodeit [found and fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4578) a bug that would allow mutating a `let` constant of a non-class protocol type. There's an example in the pull request. Also, this is one of the best pull requests I've ever seen! ðŸ˜Ž

Doug Gregor [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4529) an amendment to [SE-0112](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0112-nserror-bridging.md) that provides default implementations for all of the `CustomNSError` requirements.

Ankit Aggarwal [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/625) documentation for the SwiftPM manifest file. ðŸ‘Œ Reminder: improving documentation is a great way to get involved!

### Proposals

Still [nothing to see here](https://media.giphy.com/media/4pMX5rJ4PYAEM/giphy.gif)!

### Mailing lists

The mailing lists are still relatively quiet. I suspect the Core Team, as well as many other teams at Apple, are busy preparing for next week's event. There are some small threads, but [most pitches](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160822/026726.html) are [being deferred](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160829/026796.html) from formal discussion due to being out of scope for Swift 4 stage 1. It's clear that the Core Team is focused on completing the goals for Swift 4, and avoiding some of the "distractions" that were present the Swift 3 release cycle &mdash; namely, the overwhelming feedback and involvement from the open source community. To be clear, this wasn't *a bad thing* but it dramatically impacted the roadmap for Swift 3. ðŸ˜„ It seems like swift-evolution may be quieter during Swift 4.

### Finally

And finally &mdash; did you hear about the new [access control modifier in Swift 4](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/768558067885551616)? ðŸ˜‚
