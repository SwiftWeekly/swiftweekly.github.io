Welcome to issue #13 of the weekly brief! This week Apple released beta 6 of iOS 9.3, watchOS 2.2, and OS X 10.11.4, with no new beta for Xcode 7.3 &mdash; the final release should be getting close!

### Starter tasks

What's this new section of the weekly brief?! Last week Brian Gesiak [suggested](https://twitter.com/modocache/status/704461870627844096) including a list of introductory tasks to help beginners or new comers get involved. It's an awesome idea, and should be super helpful for the community. However, finding good tasks can be rather involved and I already have trouble finding free time üòÅ &mdash; so I'm asking for your help! üòÑ If you come across a good starter task, let me know by opening [an issue]({{ site.links.issue }}) or [pull request]({{ site.links.pull }}) &mdash; or tweet [to me](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires) or [@swiftlybrief]({{ site.links.twitter }}). Each week, I'll list any submitted tasks here.

For this week, Brian has kindly offered a few [suggestions](https://twitter.com/modocache/status/707819290175651841):

1. [SR-907](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-907): Add convenience XCTestExpectation constructors
2. [SR-906](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-906): Allow XCTestCase.continueAfterFailure to be set
3. [SR-875](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-875): Make swift-corelibs-xctest Functional tests regex matching more like FileCheck

If you are unsure or intimidated about contributing, I know a guy that gave [a talk](https://speakerdeck.com/jessesquires/contributing-to-open-source-swift) about this recently that might help motivate you! üòâ

### Commits and pull requests

Anna Zaks [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1434) basic address sanitizer (ASan) support. This allows catching and diagnosing memory corruption errors, which are possible
when using unsafe pointers. *"This patch introduces a new driver/frontend option `-sanitize=address` to enable ASan function instrumentation."* üòé [Live dangerously](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/704513575801335808). (I missed this from last week!)

Eugene Gubin [submitted a fix](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/276) to correct the wrong behavior of `NSArray.indexOfObject(_: ...)` in corelibs-foundation.

Max Howell [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/174) Xcode project generation for Swift package manager. This is the start of [the plans](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160215/010679.html) for Xcode integration in SPM. üëè

Dmitri Gribenko [started work](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1545) on the new collection indexing model for Swift 3.

Ankit Aggarwal [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/168) changes to SPM that add `-h` and `--help` to `swift test`, and allow passing arguments to `-XCTest` directly. These changes were proposed in [SE-0019](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0019-package-manager-testing.md), *Package Manager Testing*.

Shawn Erickson also [contributed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1559) to the Swift 3 indexing model work-in-progress, building out the `Collection.next(i: Index) -> Index` APIs. üôá

Brian Croom [submitted a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/64) to corelibs-xctest that allows selecting a particular test or test case to run from the command line. [Very cool](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/64#issuecomment-192963006). üòé

Greg Titus [started](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1557) [work](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1610) on `typealias` versus `associatedtype` in protocols for Swift 3. These changes remove the Swift 2.2 use of `typealias` and make `associatedtype` required for generic constraints in protocols, and allow using `typealias` as an actual type alias.

Brian Gesiak [committed](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/commit/df734dee53bc501da19948cbb8c266a093fa076e) adding the asynchronous testing API (`XCTestCase.waitForExpectationsWithTimeout()`) to corelibs-xctest. This means asynchronous testing is now available on Linux! üëè

Jason Molenda [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1589) changes that allow Swift to be build for iphoneos-armv7s (used in Apple A6 and later 32-bit devices).

Ankit Aggarwal opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/183) for a basic implementation of [SE-0038](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0038-swiftpm-c-language-targets.md), allow SPM to be used to create and build C libraries! üéâ For clients, it looks like all you need to do is include your C sources and a `.modulemap`. üòé

Maxim Moiseev migrated [corelibs-foundation](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/281) and [corelibs-xctest](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/60) to Swift 3, per the Swift 3 API guidelines changes.

### Proposals

Erica Sadun continued her rigorous effort in refining Swift, this time with proposal [SE-0046](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0046-first-label.md): *Establish consistent label behavior across all parameters including first labels*. It was [initially suggested](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/012209.html) by Joe Groff, and Erica [took it from there](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/707691862836924416).

>"We propose to normalize the first parameter declaration in methods and functions. [...] This will create a simple, consistent approach to parameter declaration throughout the Swift programming language and bring method and function declarations in-sync with initializers, which already use this standard."

For example, supposed you have `func foo(x: Int, y: Int)`. Before this change, calling the function would look like this: `foo(2, y: 3)`. After this change, it becomes `foo(x: 2, y: 3)`, which is currently how initializers behave. You could opt-out of this new behavior by declaring `func foo(_ x: Int, y: Int)` instead. üëè Support for this is **overwhelmingly** positive and I couldn't agree more! üéâ I often find myself writing `func foo(x x: Int, y: Int)` and I hate it.

There was exciting news on swift-evolution last Thursday &mdash; after issue #12 was already out &mdash; the "big 3" proposals were all finally accepted *with modifications*. üòé The summaries in the announcement emails provide a great overview, so follow the links below! Erica Sadun also has a [great article](http://ericasadun.com/2016/03/03/swift-evolution-acceptances-the-big-three/) on this.

- [SE-0023](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0023-api-guidelines.md): *API Design Guidelines*, [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000053.html). The most notable modification here is for [argument labels](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/#argument-labels).
- [SE-0006](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0006-apply-api-guidelines-to-the-standard-library.md): *Apply API Guidelines to the Standard Library*, [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000054.html). The work for this is happening on the [swift-3-api-guidelines](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/swift-3-api-guidelines) branch.
- [SE-0005](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0005-objective-c-name-translation.md): *Better Translation of Objective-C APIs Into Swift*, [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000055.html). Here's an example:

{% highlight swift %}
// Objective-C
- (void)exchangeSubviewAtIndex:(NSInteger)index1
            withSubviewAtIndex:(NSInteger)index2;

// Swift
func exchangeSubview(at index1: Int, withSubviewAt index2: Int)
{% endhighlight %}

Proposal [SE-0026](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0026-abstract-classes-and-methods.md): *Abstract classes and methods* has been [deferred](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000056.html) from Swift 3, but will be revisited in the future. While the core team acknowledges that Swift's protocols (currently) fall short in providing all features of abstract classes, they simply do not have the bandwidth to participate in the design of such an important feature. After Swift 3 goals are met, if protocol deficiencies/limitations still exist, the team wants to reconsider this proposal. Personally, I would like to see advancements in protocols (stored properties, default implementations, etc.) instead of the introduction of abstract classes.

Jeff Kelley's proposal, [SE-0033](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0033-import-objc-constants.md): *Import Objective-C Constants as Swift Types*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/011996.html)! This proposal aims to import groups of constants (typically strings) as enums. *"There was clear consensus in both the review feedback I received and within the core team that this was a simple, obvious enhancement to the importing logic."*

Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0039](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0039-playgroundliterals.md): *Modernizing Playground Literals*, is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000058.html). This is a rather straight-forward &mdash; and very nice &mdash; syntax refinement for playground literals. I'm sure it will be accepted. üòÑ

Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0040](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0040-attributecolons.md): *Replacing Equal Signs with Colons For Attribute Arguments*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000059.html) **for Swift 3**! *"The community and core team uniformly agree that this proposal increases uniformity in the swift language."* It's really great to see these refinements! And once again, Daniel Duan has *already submitted* a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1537) to implement this! üòé

### Mailing lists

Russ Bishop [started a thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160222/011032.html) on bridging and inter-op with Objective-C and [drafted](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/198) a new proposal, *Allow Swift types to provide custom Objective-C representations*. He suggests exposing the private protocol `_ObjectiveCBridgeable` as a public protocol `ObjectiveCBridgeable` to allow you to opt-in to controlling how types bridge from Swift to Objective-C by converting them into and back from an entirely separate `@objc` type. *"This frees library authors to create truly native Swift APIs while still supporting Objective-C."* Feedback on the mailing lists is [positive](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/012168.html) so far. From [Doug Gregor](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/011998.html): *"I think this is definitely worthy of a proposal"*.

Erica Sadun [started](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160229/011939.html) an interesting discussion on adopting a new common error type outside the bounds of `NSError`. *"Swift's redesigned error mechanism differs significantly from `NSError` in that its primary consumer are API calls, via the try-catch mechanism and not end-users. I would not like Swift to be tied down to an archaic construct for the sake of consistency."* [David Owens](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160229/011944.html) and [Kevin Ballard](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160229/011966.html) provided some good feedback.

There's been an on-going discussion about [removing failable initializers](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160229/011631.html) and replacing them with *throwable* initializers, started by James Campbell. Overall, the community does not support this idea. Early on, Brent Royal-Gordon [pointed out](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160229/011783.html) the unnecessary complexity and overhead of this approach. This week, [Austin Zheng](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/012107.html) provided a well-articulated and very practical argument against this, *"If the argument is that taking away `init?` is going to force Swift users to embrace the One True Path of Error Handling, I don't think that's going to happen. The more likely outcome is that people are going to wrap throwable initializers in factory methods returning optionals, and throw away whatever error returns."* I think failable initializers have the potential to be misused/abused/overused, and agree that throwable initializers would not provide any value. You can *almost always* design your APIs such that you don't need `init?`.

Dmitri Gribenko [posted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/012037.html) a request for comment on a new collections model. *"What does everyone think about requiring indices to conform to `Hashable`, in addition to the existing requirements for `Equatable` and `Comparable`? I don't think this should limit any viable collection designs, and yet might be useful, for example, to store indices in a set."* It's an interesting idea, though Pyry Jahkola [pointed out](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/012054.html) that clients could simply enforce this on their own.

Joe Groff [started a thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/012099.html) on universal equatability, hashability, and comparability. He outlines how and why Swift could provide universal behavior for `==`, `hashValue`, and/or `<`. Feedback is mixed with concerns over correctness of default/generated definitions. [Austin Zheng](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/012116.html) argued against this idea, while [William Dillon](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/012197.html) gave it a +1.

### Finally

And finally &mdash; Slava *finally* [caught something](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/707103183441494017) useful in a [code review](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/aacdf62e8b059788b4994063c7fc2f76b2aa60de). üòÇ
