Wow, it's been quite the week! There has been a lot going on this week, and quite a few swift-evolution proposals have landed. And not the smallest ones either: what about Automatic `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformance for example? Swift 4.1 is shaping up to be a great release that will make our lives even easier. üèéüí®

### Swift Unwrapped

[Episode 32: Migrating to Swift 4](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/89162): JP and Jesse share their thoughts on the transition to Swift 4.

### News and community

Kubra Mracek improved the display of fatal errors and wrote a blog post [on Swift.org](https://swift.org/blog/xcode-9-1-improves-display-of-fatal-errors/) describing the changes. Now, you will see where and why a failure occurred, which is a big improvement to the previous ambiguous errors the main function.

### Commits and pull requests

Tony Allevato's [SE-0185: *Synthesizing `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformance*](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0185-synthesize-equatable-hashable.md) [was merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0185-synthesize-equatable-hashable.md)! This is huge ‚Äî it provides automatic `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformance for types for whose members are all `Equatable` or `Hashable`. üò±üéâ

Greg Spiers [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11744) [SE-0186: *Remove ownership keyword support in protocols*](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0186-remove-ownership-keyword-support-in-protocols.md).

Robert Widmann [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12397) that implements [SE-0155: *Normalize Enum Case Representation*](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0155-normalize-enum-case-representation.md).

Javi Soto [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12295) to make `+new` unavailable when `-init` is too.

Doug Gregor made [some more improvements](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12321) for type checking in the standard library. [Another 16% speedup](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/916452691840241664)!

David Ungar [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12335) to speed up compilation for full rebuilds in non-WMO (Whole Module Optimization) mode. And there's [more to come](https://twitter.com/senderPath/status/917270872209055744)!

Chris Lattner [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12338) with some small improvements to the optimizer.

Recursive protocol constraints are now available on [the master toolchain](https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift/status/918159453467295744)!

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0184](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0184-unsafe-pointers-add-missing.md): *Unsafe[Mutable][Raw][Buffer]Pointer: add missing methods, adjust existing labels for clarity, and remove deallocation size* was [accepted with revisions](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-October/000405.html).

> It was a large proposal for which most parts received a lot of support, while other parts were contentious. The proposal is accepted with revisions:
>
> - Partial initialization/assignment will be removed from this proposal and discussed separately
> - Some argument labels will be changed for clarity (`bytes` -> `byteCount`, `alignedTo` -> `alignment`)
> - The `count` argument to `deallocate()` will be removed entirely

[SE-0186](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0186-remove-ownership-keyword-support-in-protocols.md): *Remove ownership keyword support in protocols* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-September/000404.html).

> The proposal has been accepted.
>
> Feedback for the proposal ‚Äî which many interpreted as being mostly a compiler bug fix ‚Äî was limited but unanimously positive.  The consensus was that removing the support for these ownership keywords in protocols removes false expectations on their behavior, which could be a source of bugs.

### Mailing lists

Jordan Rose [pitched a proposal](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171002/040261.html) to restrict cross-module struct initializers.

> While working on the non-exhaustive enums proposal I had it pointed out to me that structs actually currently leak implementation details across module boundaries, specifically their full set of stored properties. This only comes up in one place: when making an initializer for the struct in an extension in another module. We really want people to be able to change the stored properties in their structs between releases without it being a source break‚Äîthat's half the point of computed properties‚Äîand it's also important for a struct author to be able to enforce invariants across the struct's properties.

There's already a [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/753) and an [initial implementation](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12352).

Chris Lattner is [back to square one](https://twitter.com/olebegemann/status/917710728194347009).
