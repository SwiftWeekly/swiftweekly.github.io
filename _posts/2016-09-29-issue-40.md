With 1,653 votes, [this](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/780028892794978304) Twitter poll shows a majority of people building their current and future macOS/iOS apps in Swift. The poll is a good reminder that many professional app developers now rely on the Swift compiler, even as it continues to rapidly grow and change. On the one hand, that means contributors like you and I can have a positive, immediate impact on many developers. On the other hand, there's a great deal of people who may be inconvenienced by a bug, so maintainers will need to be careful about how to vet contributions.

How has Swift grown this week? In this brief, we discuss conditional protocol conformances, building the Swift runtime for Android from a macOS host machine, improved diagnostics, and proposals to add compile time debugging options.

### Starter tasks

Do you have experience writing Python, and want to learn more about the tools used to test Swift, Clang, and LLVM? Daniel Dunbar has [asked](https://twitter.com/daniel_dunbar/status/780436782605230080) for help maintaining [lit](http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html), the LLVM Integrated Tester. You can follow the [LLVM Getting Started Guide](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) to download the LLVM source code. LLVM uses Phabricator for code reviews, and you can learn how to use it [here](http://llvm.org/docs/Phabricator.html). Brian Gesiak [added](https://reviews.llvm.org/D24968) instructions on how to run lit's test suite, and where to look for work to be done.

### Commits and pull requests

Swift 3.0.1 Preview 1 has been [released](https://github.com/apple/swift/releases/tag/swift-3.0.1-PREVIEW-1).

Shortly after it was featured in last week's brief, Erik Eckstein [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4927) a [bug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1901) that forced internal Foundation and XCTest symbols to be marked as `public`. Thanks to this, Brian Gesiak was able to [correct](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/174) access controls for API in XCTest.

Joe Groff [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4933) the second half of [SE-0139](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0139-bridge-nsnumber-and-nsvalue.md) by bridging Swift numeric types to Objective-C `NSNumber`.

Andrew Trick [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4954) evolution proposal [SE-0138](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0138-unsaferawbufferpointer.md), adding `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` and `UnsafeRawMutableBufferPointer` to the standard library.

Brian Gesiak [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4972) a pull request that allows macOS host machines to compile the Swift runtime for Android. Previously only Linux machines could compile for Android.

Work continues to improve compiler diagnostics. Harlan Haskins [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4980) a compiler assertion that occurred when incorrectly using `var` for type-inferred parameters in closures, such as `takesClosure { (var d) in d }`. With Harlan's change, this now produces the error "parameters may not have the 'var' specifier". Mark Lacey [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4998) this confusing error message:

{% highlight swift %}
func foo(x: Int, _ y: Int) -> Int {
  return x + y
}

func bar() -> Int {
  return foo(3, 5) // error: unnamed argument #2 must precede unnamed argument #1
}
{% endhighlight %}

Mark's work corrects the error message:

{% highlight swift %}
func bar() -> Int {
  return foo(3, 5) // error: missing argument label 'x' in call
}
{% endhighlight %}

Dave Abrahams [uploaded](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3796) a work-in-progress pull request from Maxim Moiseev that implements [SE-0104](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md), protocol-oriented integers. If you're curious what pull requests look like before they're ready to merge, take a look!

@lplarson [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4989) an option to the script used to build the Swift compiler that allows it to be built with [profile guided optimization](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#profile-guided-optimization). It'll be interesting to see whether this results in improved Swift compiler performance! To learn how you can use this advanced Clang feature in your own applications, read Apple's [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/xcode_profile_guided_optimization/pgo-using/pgo-using.html).

Eli Perkins [marked](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4929) `UnicodeScalar.utf16` and `UnicodeScalar.UTF16View` as `public`, completing one of the starter tasks introduced in last week's brief. Despite being a "starter" task, it [almost](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160919/027240.html) turned into a Swift evolution proposal -- phew!

Daniel Müllenborn [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4928) a badge to the Swift README that displays the build status of Swift on Ubuntu 16.04. Swift now runs on Ubuntu 14, 15, and 16.

Ben Rimmington [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/534) support for proposals implemented in Swift 3.0.1 and 4.0. SE-0140 is now missing from the [site](http://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/), although it has already been [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/1202af531896d3e1708708ff09e4f6dd91d43f47).

### Proposals in review

Proposal [SE-0141](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0141-available-by-swift-version.md): *Availability by Swift version* from Graydon Hoare is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-September/000286.html).

> Swift's existing `@available(...)` attribute indicates the lifecycle of a given declaration, either unconditionally or relative to a particular platform or OS version range.
> 
> It does not currently support indicating declaration lifecycle relative to Swift language versions. This proposal seeks to extend it to do so.

Proposal [SE-0142](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0142-associated-types-constraints.md): *Permit where clauses to constrain associated types* from David Hart, Jacob Bandes-Storch and Doug Gregor is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-September/000287.html).

> This proposal seeks to introduce a `where` clause to associated type declarations and improvements to protocol constraints to bring associated types the same expressive power as generic type parameters.

Proposal [SE-0143](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0143-conditional-conformances.md): *Conditional Conformances* from Doug Gregor, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-September/000288.html). The proposal is a big part of the [generics
manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md#conditional-conformances-), and will likely have a large impact upon Swift code in the standard library and beyond.

> Conditional conformances express the notion that a generic type will conform to a particular protocol only when its type arguments meet certain requirements. For example, the `Array` collection can implement the `Equatable` protocol only when its elements are themselves `Equatable`, which can be expressed via the following conditional conformance on `Equatable`:

{% highlight swift %}
extension Array: Equatable where Element: Equatable {
  static func ==(lhs: Array<T>, rhs: Array<T>) -> Bool { ... }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Mailing lists

Brian Michel [proposed](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2741) adding options for the compiler to output structured information about compilation times.

Daniel Dunbar [noticed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160919/003020.html) a large regression in how long it took to compile the Swift package manager source code. It appears a change in LLVM has caused the issue, but what exactly caused it has yet to be pinpointed.

### Finally

What's the [most Swift emoji](https://twitter.com/stephentyrone/status/781532588057976832) you can think of? 🤔
