### Podcasts

Jesse and JP [talk about](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/279806) the pitch for an official style guide & formatter for Swift.

[John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) and [Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) [talk about](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/42) Swift 5, looking at ABI stability and what it means for the future of the language.

### News and community

Swift 4.2.3 for Linux [was released](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-4-2-3/21089)!

[Keith Smiley](https://twitter.com/SmileyKeith/) shared [an overview](https://gist.github.com/keith/3f01e1c9b763e9aceb70411927a0c42c) of Xcode build settings to compiler flags for Swift memory exclusivity.

[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/) shared [an interesting easter egg](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/1098628355539124224): the [magic number](https://t.co/VE0jlyjZWA) for `swiftmodule` files is `E2 9C A8 0E`, or `✨14`, referring to the initial name for Swift and its (planned) release year.

The Server Side Swift Conference [posted](https://www.serversideswift.info/videos) all its videos from their latest event.

Ray Wenderlich [created](https://www.raywenderlich.com/server-side-swift) an overview of Server Side Swift resources.

Swift will once again [participate](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-to-participate-in-gsoc-2019/20937) in the Google Summer of Code project this year.

[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN) shed [some more light](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/1098628355539124224) on Swift's initial "Shiny" name and where this can still be found within the project. ✨

### Proposals in review

[SE-0243](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0243-codepoint-and-character-literals.md): *Integer-convertible character literals* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0243-codepoint-and-character-literals/21188).

> Swift’s `String` type is designed for Unicode correctness and abstracts away the underlying binary representation of the string to model it as a `Collection` of grapheme clusters. This is an appropriate string model for human-readable text, as to a human reader, the atomic unit of a string is (usually) the extended grapheme cluster. When treated this way, many logical string operations “just work” the way users expect. 
>
> However, it is also common in programming to need to express values which are intrinsically numeric, but have textual meaning, when taken as an ASCII value. We propose adding a new literal syntax takes single-quotes (`'`), and is transparently convertible to Swift’s integer types. This syntax, but not the behavior, will extend to all “single element” text literals, up to and including `Character`, and will become the preferred literal syntax these types.

[SE-0244](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0244-opaque-result-types.md): *Opaque Result Types* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0244-opaque-result-types/21252).

> This proposal introduces the ability to hide the specific result type of a function from its callers. The result type is described only by its capabilities, for example, to say that a function returns a `Collection` without specifying which specific collection. Clients can use the resulting values freely, but the underlying concrete type is known only to the implementation of the function and need not be spelled out explicitly.

### Swift Forums

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd) shared [an interesting progress update](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-swift-takes-flight/20845) on Swift on Windows.

> After the Swift/Win32 post, I figure that some people may be curious as to the actual state of Swift for Windows. Well, I would like to share a small status update to that end.
>
> This has been a rather interesting and fun journey. I feel that up until this point, we have been making progress, but the surface area is pretty high, particularly for a single person to take on. I have been chipping away at this for a while now. However, as of today, I think that the situation is about to change. I have finally managed to get the compiler, the support libraries, the runtime, standard library, libdispatch, and now, Foundation to build and run on Windows!

Awesome work! 🎉

[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/protocol-assoctype-t-shorthand-for-combined-protocol-and-associated-type-constraints-without-naming-the-constrained-type/21217) that introduces a shorthand for combined protocol and associated type constraints without naming the constrained type.

> Swift's notation for generic constraints generally requires naming the things being constrained; you say that a particular generic parameter conforms to a protocol by naming the generic parameter and the protocol it conforms to, like `<C: Collection>`, and you put further constraints on its associated types by naming them in a where clause, like `C.Element: Equatable`. However, opaque result types, generalized existentials, and other conceivable future language features need a way to describe constraints on a type that doesn't otherwise have a name; an opaque type is intentionally hidden from the interface, and an existential's contained type is dynamic and can change at runtime. I can see this evolving into its own major design discussion so I figured it's a good idea to spin this off from the initial opaque result types proposal.
>
> To kick things off, I'd like to suggest borrowing another idea from Rust here: In Rust, you can use `T: Trait<Assoc = Type>` as shorthand for a combined constraint that `T` implements `Assoc` and that `T.Assoc` is same-type-constrained to `Type`, as if you'd written `T: Trait where T.Assoc = Type`. This shorthand can also be used in Rust's equivalents of opaque types (`impl Trait<Assoc = Type>`) and existentials (`dyn Trait<Assoc = Type>`) in addition to generic type constraints. If we were going to do something similar for Swift, we could generalize it a bit so that the shorthand can be used for both protocol and same-type constraints on associated types and to allow constraints between associated types. The result might look something like this:

{% highlight swift %}
// Leading dot is used to refer to an associated type
T: Protocol<.Type == Int> // T: Protocol where T.Type == Int
T: Protocol<.TypeA == .TypeB> // T: Protocol where T.TypeA == T.TypeB
T: Protocol<.Type: OtherProtocol> // T: Protocol where T.Type: OtherProtocol
{% endhighlight %}

[Tony Allevato](https://twitter.com/tony_allevato) and [Dave Abrahams](https://twitter.com/daveabrahams) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-an-official-style-guide-and-formatter-for-swift/21025) to introduce an official style guide and formatter for Swift.

> We propose that the Swift project adopt a set of code style
> guidelines and provide a formatting tool that lets users easily
> diagnose and update their code according to those guidelines.
>
> At the time of this writing, there is no single style agreed on
> by developers using Swift. Indeed, even Apple's own Swift
> projects on GitHub—such as the standard library, Foundation,
> Swift NIO, and so forth—have adopted their own varying styles.
> Furthermore, in many cases the code in those projects—despite
> the owners' best efforts—is not always completely consistent in
> terms of style.

[Michael Ilseman](https://twitter.com/Ilseman) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-contiguous-strings/21206) to introduce the concept of contiguous strings.

> One of the most common API requests from performance-minded users of string is a way to get direct access to the raw underlying code units. Now that Swift 5 uses UTF-8 for its preferred encoding, we can provide this.
>
> “Contiguous strings” are strings that are capable of providing a pointer and length to validly encoded UTF-8 contents in constant time.

[Johannes Weiss](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss) has [announced](https://forums.swift.org/t/development-open-for-swift-4-2-4-for-linux/21287) that development for Swift 4.2.4 for Linux is now open.

> Having released Swift 4.2.3, the February 2019 release where we could land a good number of fixes, we're now happy to open the development of Swift 4.2.4 for Linux.
