    heading: The easiest way to create your own UI controls for iOS
    body: Unfortunately, there is no standard components in iOS to compose drawings, so we are forced to use cumbersome rendering directly on graphics context.  Community of iOS developers on Github offers several frameworks to describe graphic components as a scene of primitives. Nowadays, Macaw is the most powerful framework allowing you to create custom components, charts, diagrams and use SVG files. It's an open source project with 4K+ starts on Github, so take it, use it, and make your life easier.

It has been [more than a year](https://twitter.com/swiftlybrief/status/1090341325277417473)
since I took over curating the Swift Weekly Brief from [Jesse](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires).

When Jesse announced that issue 100 would be the Brief's final issue, I reached
out to him, having helped out with the Brief in the past, to take over the project.

Not only did I really care about this project, but I also felt that it would be
a shame to lose this resource for all of you... and myself. I happily took over
the project (and still feel very fortunate to continue the effort to this day!)
and here we are.

I hope to continue the effort for the foreseeable future! That said, keeping up
a newsletter is no easy feat and [any help](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly/swiftweekly.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
is very much appreciated.

I want to thank all of the readers, sponsors and specifically contributors over
the last year. You all rock!

Here is to the next year of the Brief! üèé

### Podcasts

On Swift Unwrapped, Jesse and JP discuss [Key Path Expressions as Functions](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/262630).

On the Swift Community Podcast, Garric, Chris and myself discuss [Scaling A Codeless Open Source Swift Community](https://www.swiftcommunitypodcast.org/episodes/2).

### News and community

[Johannes Weiss](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss/) announced [Swift 4.2.2 and monthly Swift 4.2.X releases for Linux](https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-swift-4-2-2-and-monthly-swift-4-2-x-dot-releases-for-linux/20148)!

> [..] from now on we will be releasing monthly Swift 4.2.x dot versions for Linux over the next few months. That means you can expect Swift 4.2.3 by the end of February 2019, 4.2.4 by the end of March 2019 and so on.

On the Swift.org blog, [Andrew Trick](https://twitter.com/AndrewTrick)
wrote [about Swift 5's Exclusivity Enforcement](https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-exclusivity/).

[Nathan Hawes](https://github.com/nathawes/) also wrote on the Swift.org blog,
about [the `sourcekitd` Stress Tester](https://swift.org/blog/sourcekitd-stress-tester/).

Apple released the first Xcode 10.2 beta some time ago. The [release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_2_beta_release_notes/swift_5_release_notes_for_xcode_10_2_beta)
are now available on the website, without having to login to access the PDF anymore!

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/) shared [a thread](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/1092845931131817985)
about the ability to Swift compiler to be able to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Type from a mangled type string stored in the binary‚Äôs debug info.

### Commits and pull requests

[Rintaro Ishizaki](https://twitter.com/rintaro) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/22177)
that fixes a SourceKit regression in Swift 5 ‚Äî within about 12 hours after it
was reported!

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r/) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/1966)
to automatically add package dependencies using SwiftSyntax and libSwiftPM. üéâ

[Suyash Srijan](https://twitter.com/suyashsrijan) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/22231)
resolves an issue where using a `typealias` as an argument to `@escaping` on a generic function inside a protocol would trigger an error diagnostic.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0240](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0240-ordered-collection-diffing.md): *Ordered Collection Diffing* was [accepted with modifications](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0240-ordered-collection-diffing/20008).

> The proposal is accepted with modifications, specifically:
>
> - The algorithm's semantic guarantees have been weakened to specify that it will produce a difference to get from the `self` state to the `other` state, but not guarantee the shortest such difference. The intent is to allow the standard library to provide a balanced algorithm that provides the shortest difference when possible (e.g., for inputs with fewer differences) but won't exhibit quadratic behavior for large inputs with many differences.
> - The name of the algorithm itself is changed from `shortestEditScript(from:)` to `difference(from:)`.
> - The name of the collection of differences is changed from `OrderedCollectionDifference` to `CollectionDifference`.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0241](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0241-string-index-explicit-encoding-offset.md): *Deprecate String Index Encoded Offsets* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0241-explicit-encoded-offsets-for-string-indices/19929).

> [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md) introduced a computed variable and initializer surrounding the concept of an `encodedOffset` for serialization purposes. Unfortunately, that approach is flawed for its intended purpose and is commonly misused in ways that Swift 5 is [more likely to expose](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-9749). It is too late in the Swift 5.0 release to solve all existing problems, so we propose deprecating `encodedOffset` and introducing a targeted, semantics-preserving alternative.
>
> Unfortunately, [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md)‚Äôs approach of a single notion of `encodedOffset` is flawed. A string can be serialized with a choice of encodings, and the offset is therefore encoding-dependent and requires access to the contents of the string to calculate. A comment in [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md)‚Äôs example source mentioned that `encodedOffset` assumes UTF-16, which happened to be the only encoding used internally by String at the time (for offset purposes).
>
> Furthermore, the majority of uses of `encodedOffset` in the wild are not following [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md)‚Äôs intended purpose and are sensitive to encoding changes. `encodedOffset` is frequently misused under the assumption that all Characters are comprised of a single code unit, which is error-prone and Swift 5 might surface the underlying bugs in more situations. It is also sometimes used for mapping Cocoa string indices, which happens to work in Swift 4 but might not in Swift 5, and Foundation already provides better alternatives.

### Finally

Swift is hard. Especially if [you want it to be](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/1093180314526965760).
