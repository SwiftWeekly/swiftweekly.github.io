Apple announced that WWDC 2020 will be an online-only event, and many of us are learning how to work remotely from our homes while we cope with the on-going health crisis. I hope everyone is staying safe.

Meanwhile, Swift 5.2 has been officially released with Xcode 11.4. So take a break from the news and spend some time updating your projects!

He also created a [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/zntfdr/whats-new-in-swift-5-dot-2) about new features in Swift 5.2.

A great [talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gI6Zk2jS0-MNkckYBnRFNtVCHoGKHWct/view) was shared about Swift for TensorFlow which would normally have been given at TF Dev Summit.

The Ray Wenderlich folks wrote a great [tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/8016626-swiftnio-tutorial-practical-guide-for-asynchronous-problems) on how to get started with SwiftNIO.

### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28698) that fixes unapplied references to protocol methods, which was one of the oldest and most highly duped bugs ever. ðŸ˜±

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://github.com/xedin) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30627) created by [Luciano Almeida](https://github.com/LucianoPAlmeida) that resolves [SR-12382](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-12382) and improves the diagnostic for type mismatches in pointer conversion to double optionals.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30537) that fixes handling of `@autoclosure` in `init(wrappedValue:)`.

[Luciano Almeida](https://github.com/LucianoPAlmeida) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30440) that fixes [SR-11540](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11540) by just disfavoring overloads to closures with anonymous var that are function types with more than one argument that matches arguments of function types without arguments.

### Swift Forums

[Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/circular-buffer/34534) to introduce a `Circular Buffer`.

> Introduce the `CircularBuffer` collection type conforming to the `RandomAccessCollection`,
`RangeReplaceableCollection` and `MutableCollection` protocols. With random element
access and support for constant back and forth element insertion and deletion.
> 
> Swift currently does not have collection with both element random access
and constant O(1) elements back and front insertion and deletion. A good
usage examples for such collection are queue, deque, fixed length buffers.
Such abstractions cannot effectively be build on Array because of O(n) first element deletion.

[Aamir Nazir](https://forums.swift.org/u/aamir-nazir) opened [a discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/counting-occurrences-of-a-substring-in-a-string/34541/5) about counting occurrences of a substring in a string.

> Given the fact that Swift String class doesn't has any method for counting occurrences of a substring in a string. i.e
> Counting occurrences of `"Swift"` in `"Hello Swift Swift"` => 2
> 
> There are many alternatives available for counting occurrences of substring but I think it would be more intuitive if we add support of counting occurrences of a substring in a string.

[Nate Cook](https://twitter.com/nnnnnnnn) pitched [an idea]](https://forums.swift.org/t/main-type-based-program-execution/34624) to add a new attribute that you can use to designate a type that provides the entry point for a Swift program.

> This is a generalization of the `@UIApplicationMain` and `@NSApplicationMain` attributes that have been in Swift from the beginning, making that specialized behavior available to any library or framework.
> 
> The Swift compiler will recognize a type annotated with the `@main` attribute as providing the entry point for a program. Types marked with `@main` have a single implicit requirement: declaring a static `main()` method.

[Tom Doron](https://forums.swift.org/u/tomerd) shared [meeting notes](https://forums.swift.org/t/march-4th-2020/34617) for the Swift on the Server Workgroup March 4th, 2020 meeting.

[Karoy Lorentey](https://twitter.com/lorentey) pitched [an idea]](https://forums.swift.org/t/low-level-atomic-operations/34683) about Low-Level Atomic Operations.

>Here is a pitch for adding a limited set of low-level atomic operations to the Standard Library, including native spellings for C++-style acquire-release memory orderings. Our goal is to enable intrepid library authors to start building synchronization constructs directly in Swift.
> 
> This means we must start talking about how these things will work in Swift -- in other words, we need to start working on a concurrency memory model. Given that Swift already interoperates with the C/C++ memory model, it seems like a good idea to use that as a starting point.

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd) shared [an update on](https://forums.swift.org/t/new-swift-installer-for-windows/34692) the new Swift Installer for Windows.

[Cal Stephens](https://forums.swift.org/u/cal) started [a discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/codingkeypath-add-support-for-encoding-and-decoding-nested-objects-with-dot-notation/34710) about how to add a new `CodingKeyPath` type that allows consumers to key into nested objects using dot notation.

>Today, encoding and decoding Codable objects using the compiler's synthesized implementation requires that your object graph has a one-to-one mapping to the object graph of the target payload. This decreases the control that authors have over their `Codable` models.
> 
> I propose that we add a new `CodingKeyPath` type that allows consumers to key into nested objects using [dot notation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1416468-value).
