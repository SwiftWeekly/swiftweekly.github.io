It has been a while! The previous issue was beautifully crafted by [Kristaps
Grinbergs](https://twitter.com/fassko). Thanks again so much for that!

With all the heat (in Europe, at least...) I hope you're keeping it cool.

### News and community

SwiftNIO 2.4.0 [shipped](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss/status/1149427820948545537),
containing an important fix for everybody using HTTP/1 + upgraders, for example
WebSocket. You can read the analysis of the issue [here](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-WebSocket-NIO/issues/35).

### Commits and pull requests

[Armen Mkrtchian](https://twitter.com/armen_mkrtchian) merged
[a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25309) with non-ASCII
String case-conversion benchmarks that uncovered optimization opportunities for
ASCII strings.

[David Smith](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26007)
that implements those optimizations uncovered by Armen! 🏎

[Erik Eckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25978)
that makes Swift traps more user-friendly. By encoding the error message in the
DWARF line table, you'll see the message in `.dSYM`-symbolicated backtraces and
crash reports, without strings leaking in your binaries.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0261](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0261-identifiable.md): *Identifiable Protocol* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0261-identifiable-protocol/26602).

> This proposal introduces an `Identifiable` protocol, a general concept that
is broadly useful — for diff algorithms, user interface libraries, and other
generic code — to correlate snapshots of the state of an entity in order to
identify changes. It is a fundamental notion that deserves representation in
the standard library.

[SE-0262](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0262-demangle.md): *Demangle Function* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0262-demangle-function/27199).

> Introduce a new standard library function, `demangle`, that takes a mangled
Swift symbol, like `$sSS7cStringSSSPys4Int8VG_tcfC`, and output the human readable
Swift symbol, like `Swift.String.init(cString: Swift.UnsafePointer<Swift.Int8>) -> Swift.String`.
>
> Currently in Swift, if a user is given an unreadable mangled symbol, they're
most likely to use the `swift-demangle` tool to get the demangled version.
However, this is a little awkward when you want to demangle a symbol in-process
in Swift. One could create a new `Process` from Foundation and set it up to
launch a new process within the process to use `swift-demangle`, but the
standard library can do better and easier. 

### Swift Forums

[Delisa Mason](https://twitter.com/kattrali) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/stdlib-cleanup-callback-for-fatal-swift-errors/26977) to introduce a cleanup
callback for fatal Swift errors.

> In the event of a fatal error caused by Swift code, there is no direct way to
get the error message and context from Swift without out-of-process log parsing.
Fatal errors "fall through" to signal handlers at which point the crash context
is lost. The goal of this proposal is to provide a native Swift cleanup callback
for fatal errors without the complexity of signal handlers nor allowing
attempted recovery. This context could be written to disk or logged in a custom
format or aggregated for later analysis.

[Soroush Khanlou]() pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/require-parameter-names-when-referencing-to-functions/27048)
to require parameter names when referencing to functions.

> Some of you may remember [SE-0220](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0220-count-where.md)
my proposal that added the `count(where:)` function to sequences. This proposal
was ultimately accepted in time for Swift 5, but sadly [had to be reverted](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/22289)
because it was causing issues with the type checker.
>
> The issue was that when you reference `count`, in an expression like
`myArray.count * 5`, you could be referring to the count property, with type
`Int`, or the `count(where:)` function, which has type
`((Element) -> Bool) -> Int`, which you can refer to in shorthand as `count`.
When Swift tries to resolve what version of the `*` function to use, it has to
run through a lot more potential implementations, which explode combinatorially
as you increase the number of operators in the expression.
>
> I've thought about this problem for a while and chatted with a few folks about
the issue, and I think the simplest path forward to solve this is to require
parameter names when referencing functions.

[Iggy Drougge](https://twitter.com/idrougge) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/compilation-conditions-for-word-size/26995)
to add compilation conditions for word size.

> A lot of code written to support more than one platform contains `#if arch()`
conditions to handle differences between 32-bit or 64-bit platforms or little
and big endian CPUs. This may turn into long statements like `#if arch(x86_64)
|| arch(arm64) || arch(s390x) || arch(powerpc64) || arch(powerpc64le)`,
enumerating every (currently) supported architecture which must be handled by
that `#if ... #endif` clause.

[Jari Koopman](https://twitter.com/LotUDev) shared [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/feedback-swift-prometheus-implementation/26928)
to implement a Swift Prometheus implementation.

> Prometheus is one of the most widely used libraries for metrics in the
serverside world. SwiftPrometheus is a client side implementation in Swift,
with the ability to use it both connected to & separately from swift-metrics.
>
> With Prometheus being one of the most widely used metric reporting tools,
it's a buildstone that can not be left out in a serverside ecosystem. This
package is created for everyone to use & build upon for their metric reporting.
