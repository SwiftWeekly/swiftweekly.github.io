Welcome to issue #16! Last week's exciting news on the release of Swift 2.2 has been followed up by an [official blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-2-2-new-features/) detailing the new features. Check it out if you haven't already.

Also of interest is that Apple started a new beta program for Safari, [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/). This doesn't have much to do with Swift, but to me it seems like perhaps Swift's openness is starting to influence more teams within Apple. Maybe? The recent [CareKit](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/03/21Apple-Advances-Health-Apps-with-CareKit.html) announcement also supports this theory. Anyway, I'm still hoping for an open source Xcode. üòÅ

### Commits and pull requests

There's a new [Swift 2.2.x milestone](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?utf8=‚úì&q=milestone%3A%22Swift+2.2.x%22+) on GitHub with 19 issues closed and 2 issues open (as of this writing). I haven't seen official announcements about a Swift 2.2.1 (or 2.2.x) release, but it looks like this patch release will be coming soon.

[Kyle Yoon](https://github.com/yoonapps) completed a corelibs-xctest starter task that [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/85) `XCTestCase.expectationForNotification()`. This adds a convenient way to setup asynchronous tests for `NSNotification` on Linux. üëè

Mike Griepentrog opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/302) for an initial implementation of `NSURLCredential`.

Jordan Rose opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1878) for a work-in-progress for [SE-0055](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0055-optional-unsafe-pointers.md): *Make unsafe pointer nullability explicit using Optional*.

Manav Gabhawala merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1812) to clean up parsing of function parameter attributes, among other things. *"This pull request cleans up parsing of parameter attributes by parsing the `inout`, `let` and `var` tokens better. It cleans up the implementation to work better with [SE-0003](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0003-remove-var-parameters.md) by giving better fix-its and diagnostics for `var` as parameter attributes. It implements [SE-0053](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0053-remove-let-from-function-parameters.md) to disallow `let` as an attribute. It provides better fix-its for `inout` that are either duplicated or misplaced to better implement [SE-0031](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0031-adjusting-inout-declarations.md)."* üòé

Joe Groff opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1938) to fix crashes when calling C functions imported as protocol extension methods.

Pushkar Kulkarni [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/301) a stack corruption issue in `CFRegularExpression`. ü§ì

Nate Cook merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1924) that makes `Array`'s conformance to `RangeReplaceableCollection` visible.

Joe Groff [added support](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1816) for importing Objective-C generics as generic classes in Swift.

Brian Gesiak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/84) that adds `XCTestSuite` announcements to corelibs-xctest. *"This makes the swift-corelibs-xctest and Apple XCTest versions of `XCTestObservation` identical, bringing us closer to our Swift 3 goal of API parity."* üôå

**@tinysun212** [made the stdlib random functions portable](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1939) by removing `arc4random` and using C++ `<random>` instead. This allowed Dmitri Gribenko to [drop the dependency](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1965) on libbsd.

Chris Bailey [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/286) a missing `NSString` initializer in corelibs-foundation:

{% highlight swift %}
public convenience init(format: String, locale: AnyObject?, arguments argList: CVaListPointer)
{% endhighlight %}

Jordan Rose [fixed rdar://24547884](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1820), addressing an issue in the ClangImporter where inherited protocol conformances were not set up correctly. *"This is rdar://problem/24547884, which includes a reference to [facebook/AsyncDisplayKit#1109](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/issues/1109). (As in, this should fix that issue as well. The test case in the Radar included a stripped-down client but the full AsyncDisplayKit.)"*

Brian Gesiak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1908) that refactors the Cygwin toolchain to address "a great deal of duplication" across the various toolchains.

### Proposals

Nicholas Maccharoli's proposal, [SE-0053](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0053-remove-let-from-function-parameters.md): *Remove explicit use of `let` from Function Parameters*, has been [reviewed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000078.html) and [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000082.html) for **Swift 3**. *"Everyone agrees that including this redundant syntax is pointless given that the `var`/`inout` syntax has been removed or moved, it probably should have been included with SE-0003."* As noted above, Manav Gabhawala has a pull request opened to implement this. üëè

Michael Buckley's proposal, [SE-0016](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0016-initializers-for-converting-unsafe-pointers-to-ints.md): *Add initializers to `Int` and `UInt` to convert from `UnsafePointer` and `UnsafeMutablePointer`*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000083.html) for **Swift 3**. *"This rounds out a missing aspect of our unsafe pointer APIs. Where it was possible to convert `Int`/`UInt` to unsafe pointer, it wasn't possible to convert back (without using unsafeBitcast). Adding these converting initializers fixes this..."* This worked is being tracked at [SR-1115](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1115).

Chris Lattner's proposal, [SE-0048](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0048-generic-typealias.md): *Generic Type Aliases*, is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000077.html). *"This proposal aims to add generic typealiases to Swift."* Pretty straightforward! The proposal would allow things like `typealias Vec3<T> = (T, T, T)`. On the lists [there](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013425.html) [are](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013340.html) [a lot](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013360.html) [of](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013369.html) +1's. üòÑ

Jordan Rose's proposal, [SE-0055](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0055-optional-unsafe-pointers.md): *Make unsafe pointer nullability explicit using Optional*, is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000079.html). Overall, the [feedback](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013408.html) on the [mailing lists](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013499.html) is [positive](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013427.html).

>In Objective-C, pointers (whether to objects or to a non-object type) can be marked as `nullable` or `nonnull`, depending on whether the pointer value can ever be null. In Swift, however, there is no such way to make this distinction for pointers to non-object types: an `UnsafePointer<Int>` might be null, or it might never be. We already have a way to describe this: Optionals. This proposal makes `UnsafePointer<Int>` represent a non-nullable pointer, and `UnsafePointer<Int>?` a nullable pointer.

Chris Willmore's proposal, [SE-0054](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0054-abolish-iuo.md): *Abolish `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional` type*, is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000080.html). So far [feedback](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013465.html) is [mixed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013523.html) but mostly [positive](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013498.html).

>The `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional` (`IUO`) type is a valuable tool for importing Objective-C APIs where the nullability of a parameter or return type is unspecified. It also represents a convenient mechanism for working through definite initialization problems in initializers. However, `IUO`s are a transitional technology...
>
>This proposal seeks to limit the adoption of `IUO`s to places where they are actually required, and put the Swift language on the path to removing implicitly unwrapped optionals from the system entirely when other technologies render them unnecessary.

Chris Lattner's proposal, [SE-0049](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0049-noescape-autoclosure-type-attrs.md): *Move `@noescape` and `@autoclosure` to be type attributes*, is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000081.html). *"This proposal suggests moving the existing `@noescape` and `@autoclosure` attributes from being declaration attributes on a parameter to being type attributes. This improves consistency and reduces redundancy within the language..."*

### Mailing lists

The [bikeshedding](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012604.html) on proposal [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md): *Scoped Level Access* that began last week has continued. Ilya Belenkiy has [updated](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013551.html) the proposal with the feedback so far. It looks like the current set of keywords is: `public`, `moduleprivate`, `fileprivate`, and `private`. Look at that &mdash; the names are so clear that I don't even have to explain them. üòÑ However, there are concerns on the list about `moduleprivate`. I have to admit, I do like `internal` better. Chris Lattner [suggests](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160328/013854.html) yet another option: `public`, `internal`, `fileprivate`, `private`. This sounds perfect to me. üëç

Dave Abrahams posted [an update](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013371.html) on the naming guidelines for SetAlgebra for Swift 3. You can find a draft [here](http://dabrahams.github.io/swift-naming/SetAlgebra-Math.html).

Ankit Aggarwal started a [thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160328/000372.html) with a draft proposal for adding development packages as dependencies in SPM. It looks like [Max Howell](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160328/000373.html) supports the idea.

Philippe Hausler [announced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160321/000534.html) that he's pushed an initial implementation of `NSOperationQueue`, `NSOperation` and `NSBlockOperation`. *"It is worth noting that this implementation has a few behavioral differences between this implementation and the one implemented in Objective-C. Part of this difference is due to features like QoS not being cross platform portable or KVO not yet implementable in Swift. This is very much a work-in-progress; it needs unit tests and and a bit more polish, but hopefully it is good enough to get some work started in some other places."* Great to see this progress!

Joe Groff [pitched](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160328/013789.html) an idea on enforcing the argument order for defaulted parameters. The feedback so far is mixed, but leaning slightly in favor of enforcing the argument order.

>Many people are surprised when they find out defaulted parameters can be reordered, unlike required arguments. This special case adds complexity to the language, and runs against our general trend of treating argument labels as a significant part of an API's name, and preferring a single way of writing API calls. I think it's worth revisiting this design choice‚Äîis the special case worth the complexity? How many people take advantage of default argument reordering?

### Finally

And finally &mdash; I guess we know [Kanye‚Äôs take](https://twitter.com/NeoNacho/status/713184917899714561) on implicitly unwrapped optional now. üòÇ
