Welcome back to the weekly brief! We had a great week at [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2016/) this year! A lot has happened since last issue. The [first developer preview](https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-0-preview-1-released/) for Swift 3.0 was announced, as well as [Swift 2.3](https://swift.org/blog/swift-2-3/). Be sure to checkout the official [migration guide](https://swift.org/migration-guide/) for moving your Swift 2.x code to Swift 3. Warning: it will be a bit overwhelming, but it will be worth it! Apple also released an [Xcode 8 beta](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), along with beta OS releases for each of Apple's platforms. And finally, the [Swift Programming Language](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/swift-programming-language/id1002622538?mt=11) iBook has been updated for Swift 3 beta. You can also download the [ePub directly](https://swift.org/documentation/) from Swift.org.

While there weren't any surprises for the language itself announced at WWDC, Apple did announce [playgrounds](http://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) for iPad! I think we're all very excited about this. 😄

I was lucky enough to attend the conference and [was able to meet](https://twitter.com/zats/status/743580771143712768) most of the Swift Core Team. It was great to meet them in person, as well as [all of](https://twitter.com/KrauseFx/status/745682520415444996) the [other developers](https://twitter.com/simjp/status/743981049848307712) attending! It was a really great week. Hope to see you next year! 🤓

### Starter tasks

- [SR-1802](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1802): Swift `enum` cases are exposed to Objective-C with lowercase naming instead of title-case
- [SR-1872](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1872): Instead of polling every tenth of a second, modify `XCTestCase.waitForExpectations(withTimeout:file:line:handler:)` to use a runloop source. This task can be done entirely in Swift -- no C++, Python, or CMake knowledge required. 😊

Support for [running the Swift test suite on Android](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1714) was merged during WWDC, and there are a lot of improvements that can still be made. If you have an Ubuntu 15.10 development environment and an Android device, these may be a great way to get started to contributing to Swift on Android:

- [SR-1748](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1748): Make it possible to run the Swift test suite on an Android emulator, instead of a real device.
- [SR-1749](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1749): Allow contributors to run only tests that require an Android device, or all the tests that don't require one.
- [SR-1835](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1835): Fix a test failure that occurs when referencing `stdout` on Android.
- [SR-1836](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1836): Fix several reflection test failures on Android, by addressing a linker error.

Austin Zheng [rewrote](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3046) native hashed collection indices to provide a number of improvements to `Dictionary` and `Set`.

Erica Sadun opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3066) that adds a "macOS" alias for conditional compilation blocks.

Daniel Dunbar [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/418) changes to SwiftPM to migrate off of `fputs()`.

Alsey Coleman Miller [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/417) the `UUID` value type in corelibs-foundation for [SE-0069](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0069-swift-mutability-for-foundation.md).

### Accepted proposals

Austin Zheng's and Brent Royal-Gordon's proposal, [SE-0089](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0089-rename-string-reflection-init.md): *Renaming `String.init<T>(_: T)`*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000190.html) for **Swift 3**. 🎉

> The feedback from the community on this second round was light, which indicates that the extensive iteration on earlier rounds brought this to a good place.  The core team discussed other possibilities for the parameter label (e.g. from: instead of describing:) but ended up agreeing that a more explicit “describing:” label is the best fit for this API.
>
> Many thanks to Austin Zheng and Brent Royal-Gordon for driving this discussion, iterating on the design, and writing a great proposal!  I filed [SR-1881](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1881) to track implementation of this work.  This would be a great project for someone who wants to work on the standard library.

### Returned proposals

Anton Zhilin's proposal, [SE-0077](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0077-operator-precedence.md): *Improved operator declarations*, was [returned for revisions](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000191.html). The core team outlined a number of issues that they would like addressed in the revision. Follow the link for the rationale if you'd like to read more.

> The core design proposed is a clear win over the Swift 2 design, but the core team feels that revisions are necessary for usability and consistency with the rest of the language...

### Proposals in review

Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0101](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0101-standardizing-sizeof-naming.md): *Rename `sizeof` and related functions to comply with API Guidelines*, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000185.html).

> Upon accepting [SE-0096](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0096-dynamictype.md), the core team renamed the proposed stdlib function from `dynamicType()` to `type(of:)` to better comply with Swift's API guidelines. This proposal renames `sizeof`, `sizeofValue`, `strideof`, `strideofValue`, `align`, and `alignOf` to emulate SE-0096's example.

Joe Groff's proposal, [SE-0102](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0102-noreturn-bottom-type.md): *Remove `@noreturn` attribute and introduce an empty `NoReturn` type*, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000186.html).

> We should remove the rarely-used `@noreturn` function type attribute and instead express functions that don't return in terms of a standard uninhabited type.

Trent Nadeau's proposal, [SE-0103](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0103-make-noescape-default.md): *Make non-escaping closures the default*, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000187.html).

> The current default of closure arguments to functions (i.e., arguments to functions that themselves have function type such as `(T) -> U`) is to be "escaping", meaning they can escape the function body such as saving it to a field in a struct or a global variable. In order to say that a closure argument cannot possibly escape the function body ("non-escaping"), the developer must explicitly add an `@noescape` annotation to the argument type.
>
> This proposal switches the default to be non-escaping and requires an `@escaping` annotation if a closure argument can escape the function body. Since the escaping case can be statically detected, this annotation can be added via an error with a fixit. Other annotations that have consequences for escape semantics (e.g., `@autoclosure(escaping)`) will be altered to make use of the new `@escaping` annotation.

Adrian Zubarev's and Austin Zheng's proposal, [SE-0095](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0095-any-as-existential.md): *Replace `protocol<P1,P2>` syntax with `P1 & P2` syntax*, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000188.html).

> The current `protocol<>` construct, which defines an existential type consisting of zero or more protocols, should be replaced by an infix `&` type operator joining bare protocol type names.

A proposal from Dave Abrahams, Dmitri Gribenko, and Maxim Moiseev, [SE-0104](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md): *Protocol-oriented integers* is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000189.html).

> This proposal cleans up Swifts integer APIs and makes them more useful for generic programming.
>
> Swift's integer protocols don't currently provide a suitable basis for generic programming. See [this blog post](http://blog.krzyzanowskim.com/2015/03/01/swift_madness_of_generic_integer/) for an example of an attempt to implement a generic algorithm over integers. [...]
>
> Finally, the current design predates many of the improvements that came in Swift 2, and hasn't been revised since then.

Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0105](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0105-remove-where-from-forin-loops.md): *Removing Where Clauses from For-In Loops*, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000192.html).

> This proposal removes `where` clauses from `for-in` loops, where they are better expressed (and read) as `guard` conditions.

### Mailing lists

Not on the lists, but **@practicalswift** posted [an update](https://twitter.com/practicalswift/status/745003709264977922) on the number of open swiftc crashers. 42 open, 5090 closed. Thanks to [Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) for his hard work on these. 👏

Chris Lattner [posted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160620/021622.html) another message on *Swift 3 vs "additive" proposals*. This is great reminder to the community to stay focused on finishing Swift 3. While we don't know the *exact* deadline for Swift 3, we *do know* that it is fixed with the final release of Xcode 8 &mdash; which is fixed to the final releases of iOS, macOS, and the other platforms, which are fixed to (likely?) new hardware coming this fall. In other words, there is very little wiggle room for any of these releases to slip. There is **a lot** of work that needs to be done in just a few months!

> As I mentioned before, the Swift 3 release is winding down.  There is still time left to make changes, but it is very short.  As such, we &mdash; as a community &mdash; need to stay focused on the goals for this release, principally the goal to get to source stability.  It is very important for users of Swift that Swift 3 and the Swift 4 compiler be as compatible as possible.  This is important for the continued growth of Swift into new places, like new platforms (which don’t get the benefit of Xcode migration) and Swift Playgrounds.
>
> As such, “additive" proposals will need very strong rationale explaining why they are critical for the Swift 3 release, and we won’t be merging these proposals into the swift-evolution repository unless they have that.  We should stay focused on proposals that perfect the features we have, rather than adding new ones.
>
> Similarly, general discussions on this mailing list about blue sky additions to the language are distracting from our important goals, and the core team generally isn’t paying attention to these anyway.  I would really appreciate it if we could stay focused on what is important, until the time is right to look beyond Swift 3.  This time is in August (which will be here way too soon :-), at which point we can look to the future.  I outlined this [here earlier](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160516/017701.html).
>
> Sorry to be a “downer”, but Swift 3 really is a very important release for the Swift developer community as a whole.

### Finally

And finally &mdash; ["I tried Objective-C but I found Swift better"](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon/status/743594792081252352). Ha! 😎
