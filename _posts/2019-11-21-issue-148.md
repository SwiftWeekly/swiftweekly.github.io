I've been having a great last two weeks, including a trip to Spain for work â€”
it's always great to talk to the people in remote locations and meeting up with
them in person.

I also feel (like some of you, probably) that the holidays are really just
around the corner. Swift Weekly Brief will be here for another two issues this
year; so don't worry about that.

Speaking of the holiday feeling, it seems like a lot of interesting things are
still going on when it comes to Swift, as you can read about below.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-11724](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11724) [Compiler] Provide a diagnostic when a closure parameter is declared with type sugar
- [SR-11729](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11729) [llbuild] Add Chromium Tracing as export format option to `llbuild-analyze`
- [SR-11730](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11730) [llbuild] Improve GraphViz as export format option to `llbuild-analyze`
- [SR-11795](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11795) [Compiler] Replace `OSX` with `macOS` pretty much everywhere

### News and community

[Steve Cannon](https://twitter.com/stephentyrone) wrote [a blog post](https://swift.org/blog/numerics/)
on swift.org on `Swift Numerics`, a new open source project, partially in lieu
of an implementation for [SE-0246](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0246-mathable.md).

[Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) announced [Swift 5.1.2](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-5-1-2-released/30620),
which includes an improved type-checking algorithm that has significant
performance benefits on code using function builders (such as SwiftUI code).

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd) gave [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjlxa1NIfJc)
on bringing Swift to Windows.

[Alexis Beingessner](https://twitter.com/Gankra_) wrote [a blog post](https://gankra.github.io/blah/swift-abi/)
on how Swift achieved dynamic linking support.

[Steve Hawley](https://twitter.com/_plinth_) announced [Binding Tools for Swift](http://plinth.org/techtalk/?p=580),
which allows C# to interoperate with Swift!

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd) announced that all core
libraries have been [migrated to modern CMake (3.51.1)](https://forums.swift.org/t/all-core-libraries-have-been-migrated-to-modern-cmake/30770).

### Commits and pull requests

[Zoe Carver](https://github.com/zoecarver) is working on [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28260)
turning sequences of String comparisons into a fast switch.

[Becca Royal-Gordon](https://twitter.com/beccadax) is working on [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25656)
to make Swift `#file` strings include only the base name of the file, making
them a lot easier to digest.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28399)
that fixes a `Self` type bug that required a mere 1000 line refactoring first. ðŸ˜…

### Returned proposals

[SE-0272](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0272-swiftpm-binary-dependencies.md): *Package Manager Binary Dependencies* was [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0272-package-manager-binary-dependencies/30994).

> We had a uniformly positive response to the idea of supporting binary
dependencies in SwiftPM and the high-level design, but there are a number of
concerns that came up during review:
>
> - The option for disallowing binary dependencies was broadly considered to
not provided enough value to be included. It would also be good to clarify in
the proposal that opt-in/opt-out functionality can still be provided by clients
of libSwiftPM as a workflow feature.
>
> - Storing the checksum in the resolved file was seen redundant by some folks.
If a revision choses to omit this, we should instead propose to verify the
commit hash that is already stored there to achieve similar results.
>
> - Several posts mentioned that the API could be simplified and it would make
sense to reduce the complexity here since it isn't needed for the scoped down
version of the initial pitch that is being proposed here.
>
> - A number of points should be spelled out more concretely in the proposal:
verifications of the contents of the artifacts, the concrete layout of the ZIP
file and the behaviour if there is no artifact available for the target
platform.
>
> - Mirror support for this feature should be considered. That should include
adding a new command for specifying mirrors for binary artifacts.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0271](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0271-package-manager-resources.md): *Package Manager Resources* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0271-package-manager-resources/30730).

> Packages should be able to contain images, data files, and other resources
needed at runtime.  This proposal describes SwiftPM support for specifying such
package resources, and introduces a consistent way of accessing them from the
source code in the package.

[SE-0270](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0270-rangeset-and-collection-operations.md): *Add Collection Operations on Noncontiguous Elements* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0270-add-collection-operations-on-noncontiguous-elements/30691).

> We can use a `Range<Index>` to refer to a group of consecutive positions in a
collection, but the standard library doesn't currently provide a way to refer
to discontiguous positions in an arbitrary collection. I propose the addition
of a `RangeSet` type that can store any number of positions, along with
collection algorithms that operate on those positions.

### Swift Forums

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/infer-associated-types-as-generic-parameters-more-eagerly/30833)
to infer associated types as generic parameters more eagerly.

> This proposal changes associated type inference behavior to short-circuit a
large amount of inference work in the case where the conforming type defines a
generic parameter with the same name as an associated type.
>
> This breaks source compatibility with certain valid programs; in Swift 5.1,
it is possible for an associated type and a generic parameter with the same
name to have different types. However, the name lookup behavior in this case
was already very fragile.

[Jon Hull](https://forums.swift.org/u/jon_hull) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pre-pitch-runtime-type-guarantees/30842)
for Runtime Type Guarantees.

> There is always a tradeoff between safety and performance when writing
reusable code. Low level code either has to make assumptions about the values
being passed to it (e.g. a value is non-zero, or an array is non-empty) or it
has to check those assumptions. When these functions call one another, but
could also be called from the outside, you often find them repeatedly
performing the same check.

[Karoy Lorentey](https://twitter.com/lorentey) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-exposing-the-memory-locations-of-class-instance-variables/30584)
to expose the Memory Locations of Class Instance Variables.

> For Swift to be successful as a systems programming language, it needs to
allow efficient use of the synchronization facilities provided by the
underlying computer architecture and operating system, such as primitive atomic
types or higher-level synchronization tools like `pthread_mutex_t` or
`os_unfair_lock`. Such constructs typically require us to provide a stable
memory location for the values they operate on.
>
> Swift provides a number of language and runtime constructs that are guaranteed
to have a stable memory location.
>
> However, Swift does not currently provide ways to reliably retrieve the
address of the memory location backing these variables -- with the exception of
dynamic variables, where all access is done through an explicit unsafe pointer
whose value is (obviously) known to the code that performs the access.
