"The sky is falling! The sky is falling, and Google is forking Swift!"

Fear not, dear reader, Google doesn't appear to be "forking" the Swift project
-- no matter what the blowhards on some venture capitalist's forum board tell
you. Instead, Google employees will simply be using [google/swift](https://github.com/google/swift)
as a staging area for their pull requests to the main [apple/swift](https://github.com/apple/swift)
project. In fact, this week we already saw some incredible contributions from
Google engineers, including support for Fuchsia OS!

So while the internet tries to get a rise out of you, just keep reading Swift
Weekly Brief to learn what's _really_ going on in Swift -- I promise you it'll
be less melodramatic than what's "trending" on Twitter. üòè

### Starter tasks

[SR-6360](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6360): Ever try to type
`UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer`, but end up writing
`UnsafeRawMutableBufferPointer` instead? It's a reasonable mistake, and the
Swift compiler should inform users that they switched the placement of `Raw`
and `Mutable`. Check the comments on this one for some helpful hints from
[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN).

### Swift Unwrapped

[Episode 36: Swift Evolution - Current Topics & Proposals](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/89166):
Jesse and JP discuss some recent proposals.

### News and community

A team at Google is planning on contriuting to Swift's lib/Syntax.
[Alexander Lash](https://twitter.com/lexlash/status/930877904551944192)
[writes](https://twitter.com/lexlash/status/930877904551944192), "My team is
planning to contribute to lib/Syntax - we're interested in linting, formatting,
and refactoring." No word yet on whether they're accepting r√©sum√©s! üòâ

[John Holdsworth](https://twitter.com/Injection4Xcode) [implemented](https://github.com/johnno1962/SwiftPython)
a proof-of-concept for calling Python code from within Swift.

GitHub user [@quellish](https://github.com/quellish) [claims](https://github.com/quellish/XcodeNewBuildSystem)
that the new Xcode build system was "on average 28% faster with clean builds
and 82% faster on incremental builds" when building an open-source application
named "V2EX.app".

### Commits and pull requests

Google engineer [Zac Bowling](https://twitter.com/zbowling) has [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12955)
a pull request that adds a Fuchsia OS target to the Swift compiler (one of the
first pull requests submitted from the [google/swift](https://github.com/google/swift)
repository). In case you're keeping track, a comprehensive set of OS target
conditionals in Swift now looks like this:

{% highlight swift %}
#if os(OSX) || os(iOS) || os(tvOS) || os(watchOS)
// ...
#elseif os(Linux) || os(FreeBSD) || os(PS4) || os(Android) || os(Cygwin) || os(Fuchsia) || os(Haiku)
// ...
#endif
{% endhighlight %}

A lot of work this week has centered on conditional conformances:

- [Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12910)
  a pull request to implement `Equatable` using conditional conformances, for
  `Optional`, `Array`, and `Dictionary`.
- [Ben Cohen](https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12913)
  a work-in-progress pull request that demonstrates just how much boilerplate
  can be eliminated from the Swift standard library thanks to conditional
  conformances.
- [Huon Wilson](https://github.com/huonw) [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12531)
  changes to lib/IRGen that allow Swift to produce LLVM IR to represent
  conditional conformances.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) is going wild
reducing Swift compilation times and improving runtime performance. He [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6485)
a draft pull request with what [Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) [calls](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/928733395219185664)
"a pretty significant optimization for unspecialized Swift code," as well as
a work-in-progress [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12855)
that he [notes](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/928834964690411520)
will crack down on some redundant validation the Swift compiler performs.

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/1390)
a pull request that allows Swift package manager to build projects with the
thread sanitizer enabled.

[Alper Cugun](https://github.com/alper) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12856)
one of the starter tasks mentioned in last week's issue.

Many people (myself included) have tried to refactor Swift's Python
`build-script`. Thankfully, Apple's [Ross Bayer](https://github.com/Rostepher)
has picked up the mantle and [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12873)
a pull request.

### Accepted proposals

The review period of [SE-0187](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0187-introduce-filtermap.md):
*Introduce `Sequence.filterMap(_:)`* has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171113/041342.html)
with an additional re-review period of November 15th - 20th, in order to decide
on a new name: `filterMap`, `compactMap`, or something else entirely.

> [T]he core team feels that the central question is whether Swift benefits from
  overloading `flatMap` in this way. There is a reasonable argument that an
  `Optional` is a sort of container, and therefore it makes sense to "flatten"
  that container into a surrounding container. But Swift has resisted applying
  that interpretation in its library design; for example, you cannot directly
  iterate an `Optional` or append its contents to an Array. In general, we feel
  that using different operations for working with `Optional`s tends to make
  code easier to both write and understand, especially given the existence of
  implicit optional promotion, which we cannot eliminate or easily suppress
  based on the context. On reflection, we think it was a mistake to use the
  same name in the first place, and there is no better time to fix a mistake
  than now.

### Proposals in review

The [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-November/000408.html)
of _[SE-0189](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0189-restrict-cross-module-struct-initializers.md):
Restrict Cross-module Struct Initializers_ has begun and runs through November
21st, 2017.

> Adding a property to a public struct in Swift ought to not be a
  source-breaking change. However, a client in another target can currently
  extend a struct with a new initializer that directly initializes the struct's
  fields. This proposal forbids that, requiring any cross-target initializers to
  use `self.init(...)` or assign to `self` instead. This matches an existing
  restriction for classes, where cross-module initializers must be convenience
  initializers.

### Mailing lists

[Nicole Jacque](https://twitter.com/racer_girl27) is [seeking](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20171113/005988.html)
volunteers to join a workgroup that aims to "discuss and create a plan for the
structure for the Discourse-based forum." If you have ideas for how online
discussions of Swift should take place, please consider volunteering!

[Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) [pitched](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171106/041142.html)
adding user-defined dynamically "callable" types, as part of a series of ideas
he has around helping Swift interoperate with dynamic languages such as Python.

[Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache) [sent](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20171106/005934.html)
an email summarizing the current state of Swift compile time debugging options
such as `-debug-time-function-bodies`, and asked whether anyone had suggestions
for future work in this area. He also [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12939)
a pull request to fix an issue he mentioned in the email.

[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) [sent](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20171106/005828.html)
an email summarizing how the compiler generates type metadata records, and what
implications that has for ABI stability. His email also suggests areas to
change.

[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) [proposed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20171113/005971.html)
generalizing the nominal type descriptor data emitted as part of Swift modules'
type metadata, into something he calls "context descriptors."

Following up on his [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12789)
adding a representation for coroutines in SIL, which last week's issue of the
weekly covered, John McCall [sent](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20171113/005965.html)
a proposal for how to represent coroutine types in the Swift AST. His proposal
hints at how coroutines will be gradually introduced into Swift's syntax:

> Only special kinds of declarations can be coroutines.  In the first stage,
  that will exclusively be read/modify accessors; eventually we will add
  generators, but maybe not in Swift 5.

Last week's issue of the weekly mentioned that Erik Eckstein proposed
deprecating the `-Ounchecked` Swift compiler option. That conversation pivoted
into a discussion on whether compiler flags are subject to the Swift Evolution
process of community review. This week, [Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek)
[weighed in](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20171106/005938.html)
to make the case that they are in some cases, and this is one such case. Sounds
like we may see a proposal to remove `-Ounchecked` soon -- the first Swift
Evolution proposal related to compiler flags.

Swift is capable of running on many platforms outside of just macOS and Linux,
but those are the only platforms that are built and tested by the Swift
project's continuous integration bots. Back in September 2016, Ted Kremenek
[mentioned](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/622#issuecomment-247415912)
that support for other platforms would be added, and the clearest estimate of
when that was provided on the mailing list was ["soon"](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160919/002972.html).
This week, Ted [mentioned](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20171113/005983.html)
that the feature was tentatively planned for December 2017, but no official
announcement has yet been made.
