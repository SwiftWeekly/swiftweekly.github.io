Welcome to issue #21! There hasn't been much news this week other than [Xcode 7.3.1](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Chapters/xc7_release_notes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001051-CH5-DontLinkElementID_14) was released, so let's get on to the weekly brief. It was another huge week for proposals and it feels like the core team is moving really fast ahead of WWDC 2016. üí™

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

Austin Zheng [committed](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/0567d5f888e9a2f4b4bbd4126c9a13d44c56d847) a markdown-formatted version of Doug Gregor's *Completing Generics Manifesto*. Really great to have this in the repo instead of buried in the mailing lists!

Guillaume Lessard's [fix](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1454) for Mike Ash's weak property thread safety [bug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-192) was finally merged. üéâ

Bouke Haarsma opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/292) on SwiftPM to use `NSFileHandle` instead of `fopen`, as part of [SR-1005](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1005). üëç

Max Howell [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/296) `--update` in SwiftPM, to determine and apply updates.

Chris Willmore merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2322) with an initial implementation of [SE-0054](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0054-abolish-iuo.md): *Abolish `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional` Type*, and made the corresponding [changes](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/343) to corelibs-foundation. üëå

Brian Croom [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/102) class-level `setUp` and `tearDown` methods on `XCTestCase`.

Brian Gesiak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2364) that implements generating `XCTestCaseProvider` entries on Linux, [SR-710](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-710). üòé

**@swiftix** [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2370) some Array-related performance regressions introduced by the new indexing model. üôå

Daniel Duan [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2354) support for limiting `inout` capture to `@noescape` contexts, [SE-0035](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0035-limit-inout-capture.md).

Timothy J. Wood [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2384) his accepted proposal (see below), [SE-0061](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0061-autoreleasepool-signature.md): *Add Generic Result and Error Handling to `autoreleasepool()`*.

Ankit Aggarwal opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild/pull/28) on swift-llbuild to support `-whole-module-optimization`. *"When enabled swift compiler produces one object file and dependency file for the entire module instead of for each of the sources."*

### Accepted proposals

Stephen Canon's proposal, [SE-0067](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0067-floating-point-protocols.md): *Enhanced Floating Point Protocols*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000121.html) **for Swift 3**. üëè

> Overall, the feedback on the proposal was very positive, particularly for revision 2 of the proposal.
>
> The most significant feedback was around the naming issues for the various protocol requirements that map onto operators (e.g. ‚ÄúisLessThanOrEqualTo‚Äù).  The core team agrees that these are unfortunate - their naming is awkward and they will end up polluting code completion for instances of these numeric types. That said, we are accepting the proposal as written, because the rest of the proposal is great progress in the direction we want to go, accepting it will allow us to get experience living on it, and we can improve this issue with a follow-on proposal.
>
> To address the naming issues, we'd like to explore Tony Allevato's ideas in the ‚ÄúImprove operator requirements in protocols‚Äù thread on swift-evolution. If that doesn't work out, we request that these members be reworked to be named static members in the protocol, which will address the code completion issue.
>
> Thank you to Stephen Canon for driving the design and implementation of this, and to Max Moiseev (and several others) who have been contributing to the implementation.  This is a fundamental step to moving Swift numerics forward!

Doug Gregor's proposal, [SE-0071](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0071-member-keywords.md): *Allow (most) keywords in member references*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000122.html) **for Swift 3**. üéâ *"The discussion on swift-evolution was minimal, but entirely positive. This proposal eliminates a syntactic problem that would otherwise be new to Swift 3, with no apparent downside. What's not to love?"*

Timothy J. Wood's proposal, [SE-0061](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0061-autoreleasepool-signature.md): *Add Generic Result and Error Handling to `autoreleasepool()`*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000123.html) **for Swift 3**. üôå *"The feedback on the proposal was minimal, but all positive."* Work is being tracked at [SR-842](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-842).

Doug Gregor's proposal, [SE-0070](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0070-optional-requirements.md): *Make Optional Requirements Objective-C-only*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000124.html) **for Swift 3**. üôá *"SE-0070 is the minimal solution for clarifying optional requirements without making their important use cases overtly awkward. The core team requests that the diagnostics generated by mistakes using optional requirements be revised to make it clear that it is an Objective-C only feature."* (A starter task for this listed is above.)

Tony Parker's proposal, [SE-0069](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0069-swift-mutability-for-foundation.md): *Mutability and Foundation Value Types*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000132.html) **for Swift 3**. üòé *"The feedback on the proposal has been overwhelmingly positive."*

Jacob Bandes-Storch's proposal, [SE-0017](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0017-convert-unmanaged-to-use-unsafepointer.md): *Change Unmanaged to use UnsafePointer*, was [reviewed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000117.html) and [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000133.html) **for Swift 3**. üëç Jacob proposed replacing the usage of `COpaquePointer` with `UnsafePointer<Void>` and `UnsafeMutablePointer<Void>` in the `Unmanaged` API to reduce bloated code where users must convert from `UnsafePointer` to `COpaquePointer` to `Unmanaged`.

Kevin Ballard's proposal, [SE-0032](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0032-sequencetype-find.md): *Add `find` method to `Sequence`*, was [reviewed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000118.html) and [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000134.html) **for Swift 3**. ü§ì Kevin proposed to add a new extension method to `Sequence` called `find()` that returns the found element. *"It's often useful to find the first element of a sequence that passes some given predicate. [...] For Sequences, there's no easy way to do this besides a manual loop that doesn't require filtering the entire sequence and producing an array."*

Patrick Pijnappel's proposal, [SE-0052](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0052-iterator-post-nil-guarantee.md): *Change IteratorType post-nil guarantee*, was [reviewed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000120.html) and [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000135.html) **for Swift 3**. üëå Patrick proposed to change the behavior of `IteratorType.next()` to return `nil` indefinitely.

> The feedback on this proposal was generally positive from the community and core team. The most significant concern was about performance: strengthening the requirement on `IteratorType.next()` could make some implementations of iterators slower. On the other hand, it does make some clients faster (UTF8 decoding being one cited case that demonstrates a big win). The core team believes that the improvements to performance in the most common use-cases will more than balance the reductions in performance for other cases.

Kevin Ballard's proposal, [SE-0045](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0045-scan-takewhile-dropwhile.md): *Add `scan`, `prefix(while:)`, `drop(while:)`, and `unfold` to the stdlib*, was [reviewed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000119.html) and a subset of the proposal was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000136.html) **with modifications, for Swift 3**. üòÑ Kevin proposes adding 3 common (but currently missing from the stdlib) `Sequence` functions &mdash; `scan(_:combine:)`, `prefix(while:)`, and `drop(while:)`, with overrides as appropriate on `Collection`, `LazySequenceProtocol`, and `LazyCollectionProtocol`, as well as a global function `unfold(_:applying:)`.

> `Sequence.prefix(while:)` & `Sequence.drop(while:)` &mdash; These are *accepted* as specified in revision 3 of the proposal.
>
> `Sequence.scan(_:combine:)` &mdash; This addition is *rejected* by the core team.  While this operation is provided by other functional language libraries, its use case is narrow and not obviously as applicable for Swift programmers. Swift intentionally has a high bar for ‚Äúgeneral utility‚Äù when adding operations to the standard library: it isn't enough to be useful in some cases &mdash; it must be broadly useful by lots of people.  The core team felt like this was too narrow to be worth including.
>
> `unfold(_:applying:)` &mdash; This addition is *rejected* by the core team as written, but deserves more discussion in the community, and potentially could be the subject of a future proposal. The core team felt that the utility of this operation is high enough to be worth including in the standard library, but could not find an acceptable name for it. ‚Äúunfold‚Äù is problematic, despite its precedence in other language, because Swift calls the corresponding operation ‚Äúreduce‚Äù and not ‚Äúfold‚Äù. No one could get excited about ‚Äúunreduce‚Äù. ‚Äúiterate‚Äù was also considered, but a noun is more appropriate than an verb in this case. Given the lack of a good name, the core team preferred to reject to let the community discuss it more.

### Proposals in review

Joe Groff's proposal, [SE-0060](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0060-defaulted-parameter-order.md): *Enforcing order of defaulted parameters*, is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000125.html). *"Swift generally follows in the Smalltalk/Objective-C tradition of compound method names with significant, order-sensitive argument labels, but an exception is made for parameters with default arguments. We should remove this exception."*

F√©lix Cloutier's and Gwendal Rou√©'s proposal, [SE-0073](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0073-noescape-once.md): *Marking closures as executing exactly once*, is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000126.html). *"This proposal introduces an optional `once` argument to the `@noescape` attribute. The `@noescape(once)` attribute enforces that the closure does not escape, and that it is run exactly once on any code path returning from the function."*

A proposal from Lorenzo Racca, Jeff Hajewski and Nate Cook, [SE-0074](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0074-binary-search.md): *Implementation of Binary Search functions*, is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000127.html). *"Swift does not offer any way to efficiently search sorted collections. This proposal seeks to add a few different functions that implement the binary search algorithm."*

Janosch Hildebrand's proposal, [SE-0076](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0076-copying-to-unsafe-mutable-pointer-with-unsafe-pointer-source.md): *Add overrides taking an `UnsafePointer` source to non-destructive copying methods on `UnsafeMutablePointer`*, is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000128.html). *"`UnsafeMutablePointer` includes several methods to non-destructively copy elements from memory pointed to by another `UnsafeMutablePointer` instance. I propose adding overloads of these methods to `UnsafeMutablePointer` that allow an `UnsafePointer` source."*

Nate Cook's and Sergey Bolshedvorsky's proposal, [SE-0078](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0078-rotate-algorithm.md): *Implement a rotate algorithm, equivalent to `std::rotate()` in C++*, is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000129.html). *"This proposal is to add rotation and in-place reversing methods to Swift's standard library collections."*

Matthew Johnson's proposal, [SE-0080](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0080-failable-numeric-initializers.md): *Failable Numeric Conversion Initializers*, is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000130.html).

> Swift numeric types all currently have a family of conversion initializers. In many use cases they leave a lot to be desired. Initializing an integer type with a floating point value will truncate any fractional portion of the number. Initializing with an out-of-range value traps.
>
> This proposal is to add a new family of conversion initializers to all numeric types that either complete successfully without loss of information or throw an error.

Daniel Dunbar's proposal, [SE-0082](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0082-swiftpm-package-edit.md): *Package Manager Editable Packages* is under [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000131.html). *"This is a proposal for changing the behavior for iterative development of a group of packages. In particular, we will change the default location to which package dependency sources are cloned, the package managers behavior around those sources, and add a new feature for allowing iterative development."*

### Mailing lists

David Sweeris started a [discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160502/016286.html) on renaming "class" when referring to protocol conformance. Currently, you would constrain a protocol to only apply to reference types by doing `protocol P: class { }`. Dave Abrahams [points out](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160502/016410.html) that this has always been an awkward special case that could be replaced with `AnyObject`. I would love to see this change! To me, `protocol P: AnyObject { }` is so much more clear and consistent with the language. Adrian Zubarev also [brought this up](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160418/015568.html) last week.

Nicholas Maccharoli [proposed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160502/016437.html) the idea of introducing an `OrderedSet` type. It looks like [Austin Zheng](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160502/016529.html) is going to draft a proposal.

Erica Sadun started a [thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160502/016516.html) on adding `yes` and `no` to the stdlib as aliases for `true` and `false`. However, it looks like community is in favor of keeping a single way to express boolean values.

Sangjin Han [started](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160502/016381.html) a discussion on MSVC/Cygwin compatibility. I'm personally not very familiar with the technical details here, but it's an interesting thread!
