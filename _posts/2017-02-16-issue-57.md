This week changes to branch management for the [swift-LLDB](https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb) repository were announced, as well as a new Swift Syntax and Structured Editing library! This library aims to expand on the functionality provided by SourceKit and sounds like it could enable tons of great new tooling for Swift. Apple also announced WWDC 2017.

### News and community

The engineering team at Airbnb shared their story on [migrating to Swift 3](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/getting-to-swift-3-at-airbnb-79a257d2b656#.453vg69qn). The post covers their approach to the migration, the impact of Swift 3 on binary size and build time (both regressed, unfortunately), and some issues to watch out for. It's an interesting read and definitely highlights the risks and pain points that early adopters experienced. But hopefully that's over now. ðŸ˜…

Ole Begemann wrote an article on [implementing a sorted array](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/02/sorted-array/) in Swift, a follow-up to objc.io's [Swift Talk #35](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E35-sorted-arrays-collections-3). His post and the objc.io video provide a great in-depth look at how to write your own, efficient collections in Swift.

Apple announced [WWDC 2017](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/), which will be held June 5-9 in San Jose, CA.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0151](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0151-package-manager-swift-language-compatibility-version.md): *Package Manager Swift Language Compatibility Version* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000318.html) for Swift 4.

> There wasn't much discussion on the mailing list, but we did receive some off-list feedback that was supportive. The proposal is accepted for Swift 4.

[SE-0152](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0152-package-manager-tools-version.md): *Package Manager Tools Version* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000319.html) for Swift 4.

> There wasn't much discussion on the mailing list, but we did receive some off-list feedback that was supportive. The proposal is accepted for Swift 4.

Both proposals have already been [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/605) as well. ðŸ˜„ðŸŽ‰

### Mailing lists

David Farler [sent an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170206/004066.html) announcing work on the *Swift Syntax and Structured Editing* library:

> A truly modern compiler has to have excellent IDE and tools integration, as we have done through the SourceKit layer, providing code completion, documentation comments, syntax highlighting, and more. There's no reason to stop there, so I'd like to announce work on the Swift Syntax and Structured Editing library, which will be growing in lib/Syntax in the coming weeks. The overall goal of the library is to provide a representation and a body of APIs for structured editing on Swift syntax.
>
> The immediate goals of the library are to provide infrastructure for the Swift Migrator and for a first-class formatting tool, which we'll be bringing to the open source tree and developing publicly.

Chris Bieneman [announced changes](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170206/004048.html) to LLDB branch management:

> Over the last couple weeks we've been working on some changes to the branch management strategy for the Swift-LLDB repository. The goal is to have LLDB more closely align with the other projects forked from [LLVM.org](http://llvm.org/). We believe that making this change will simplify the contribution process for LLDB's Swift support.
>
> To this end, we are making the following changes:
>
> LLDB has gained an `upstream-with-trunk` branch which will be auto-merged from LLVM.orgâ€™s `LLDB/trunk`. This branch will contain the best of both worlds. The latest and greatest from LLVM.org, and Swift support. This branch will pair to LLVM & Clang's `upstream-with-swift` branches and Swiftâ€™s `master-next`.
>
> LLDB has also gained a stable branch which will behave the same way as the LLVM & Clang stable branches, and should be used for most Swift compiler development. Additionally we have made the `swift-lldb/stable` branch the default branch on the GitHub repository, which matches the behavior of LLVM & Clang.

David Hart started [a discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170206/031833.html) on the merit (or lack thereof) of the `final`, `lazy`, and `fileprivate` keywords. He argues that `final` has diminished value given [SE-0117](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0117-non-public-subclassable-by-default.md), that `lazy` will eventually be obsoleted by Joe Groff's [property behaviors proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0030-property-behavior-decls.md), and that `fileprivate` should be reverted (which has been discussed on the lists before). Matthew Johnson [pointed out](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170206/031835.html) that `final` still brings a lot of value, and Chris Lattner [noted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170206/031842.html) that property behaviors won't be implemented until *at least* Swift 5. The merit and utility of `fileprivate` is still in question, and the rest of the thread debates this. I would personally love to see [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md) reverted. In my experience `fileprivate` has become a burden rather than solving any tangible problems.
