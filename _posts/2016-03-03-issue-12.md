### Commits and pull requests

The other big news from the past week was Brian Gesiak's [port to Android](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1442) pull request. [This is really awesome to see.](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1442#issuecomment-188997429) 🙇 <span class="text-muted">**Note:** +1's are very much appreciated, but can be burdensome for contributors. If you'd like to comment, please [send a tweet](https://twitter.com/modocache) to Brian instead.</span> 😄

A new repository, [swift-compiler-rt](https://github.com/apple/swift-compiler-rt), appeared this week. *"This directory and its subdirectories contain source code for the compiler support routines."*

Harlan Haskins has [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1417) that adds a code coverage comparison visualization tool. 🤓

C.W. Betts submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/251) to implement `NSUserDefaults` in corelibs-foundation.

Patrick Pijnappel [rewrote](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1477) `UTF8._isValidUTF8()` to improve performance and reduce code size. Depending on the sequence, there's a 15-45% speed-up. [This is brilliant](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1477#issuecomment-189788033)! 😎

Nadav Rotem [disabled the in-lining](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/493f4e3747ce2f7faf238b809a17018593dc1bb9) of `measureExtendedGraphemeCluster`. *"This change reduced the size of the Swift standard library by about 45k (2% of the .text size)."*

Guillaume Lessard submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1454) to fix [SR-192](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-192), *"Weak properties are not thread safe when reading"*, reported by [Mike Ash](https://twitter.com/mikeash).

Honza Dvorsky opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/159) (previous discussion [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/156)) to generate `XCTestCaseProvider` entries on Linux ([SR-710](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-710)).

Ankit Aggarwal submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/149) to add support for empty source packages ([SR-793](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-793)).

Daniel Duan opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1501) to implement proposal [SE-0034](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0034-disambiguating-line.md), which replaces the line directive `#line` with `#setline`.

**@tinysun212** has [started work](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1516) on a port to Windows ([SR-34](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-34)) and integration with Visual Studio.

### Proposals

Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0034](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0034-disambiguating-line.md): *Disambiguating Line Control Statements from Debugging Identifiers*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000050.html). *"The community and core team both widely agree that this is a straight-forward fix to an uncommonly used feature."*

Daniel Dunbar's proposal, [SE-0038](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0038-swiftpm-c-language-targets.md): *Package Manager C Language Target Support*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160222/000288.html)! I'm really excited about this. I think having C language support in SPM will have a huge impact on the community. *"We didn't get a lot of commentary on this proposal, but there appears to be general support for this proposal. [...] While we now have a specification for how this feature should work, we do not yet have a schedule for when we will be able to implement it. If you are interested in contributing an implementation for this proposal, please coordinate with us on the swift-build-dev mailing list."*

David Scrève's proposal, [SE-0026](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0026-abstract-classes-and-methods.md): *Abstract classes and methods*, is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000048.html). I'm personally not a fan of this idea. I think that the problems that abstract classes and methods attempt to solve can be better solved with protocols, and design patterns that avoid the need for inheritance in the first place. [David Owens II](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160222/011163.html) and [Austin Zheng](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160222/011168.html) offer their views against and in favor, respectively. Overall feedback on the mailing lists is mixed.

Ilya Belenkiy's proposal, [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md): *Scoped Access Level*, is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000049.html). It aims to introduce a new access level modifier, `local`, which would make the specified members private to their class/struct. Support for this is mixed and I can understand both sides. [Stephen Celis](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160222/011201.html) and [Brent Royal-Gordon](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160229/011405.html) have written great responses against this. [Nate Cook](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160222/011210.html) provided his thoughts on why he thinks this is a good change. And [Joe Groff](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160222/011314.html) suggested that this might be solvable with stored properties in extensions instead.

Erica Sadun drafted two proposals for refinements to Strides. So far there is mixed but mostly positive support for each of these.

- Conventionalizing `stride` semantics ([here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/184)). *"Swift offers two stride functions, `stride(to:, by:)` and `stride(through:, by:)`. This proposal introduces a third style and renames the existing to and through styles."*
- Decoupling Floating Point Strides from Generic Implementations ([here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/185)). *"`Strideable` is genericized across both integer and floating point types. A single implementation causes floating point strides to accumulate errors through repeatedly adding `by` intervals. Floating point types deserve their own floating point-aware implementation that minimizes errors."*

### Mailing lists

Dmitri Gribenko [posted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160229/011552.html) a request for comment on proposed changes to collection indices.

>We would like to propose a major change to how collection indices
work.  The standard library team has discussed this idea internally
and we wrote a prototype.  Now we think it is a viable direction to
consider, and we are bringing it for wider public discussion.
>
>We are proposing a new model for collections, where indices can only be
advanced forward or backward by the corresponding collection instance.
Indices become opaque tokens representing collection positions, that can
be produced and consumed by collection APIs.  This allows us to reduce
the amount of data stored in indices to the bare minimum.
>
>Compared to the current state, the new scheme simplifies implementation
of non-trivial indices, and fixes concurrency issues in `Set` and
`Dictionary` indices.  It also allows us to eliminate reference-counted
stored properties from most indices, including non-trivial ones, like
`Set.Index` and `Dictionary.Index`, creating more optimizable code.

Chris Lattner made a [brief pitch](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160229/011493.html) on simplifying class initialization complexity, asking if anyone from the community could drive this project as the core team does not have time.

> If anyone is interested in picking up this as a project to scope, design, and drive, that would be great. :-)
>
>Class initialization in Swift support a wide array of knobs and concepts, including things like designated initializers, required initializers, convenience initializers, etc.  These are all required by various common patterns in Cocoa and other OO systems, but has an unfortunate side effect: all of the complexity is foisted on you at once.
>
>Wouldn’t it be great if you could freely define a new class and not have to know about required and convenience initializers?  It seems that we should only have to enforce these requirements if you a) further derive from this class within your module, or b) mark the class publicly-derivable-from.

Erica Sadun has [started a discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160222/000289.html) on disambiguating Swift Package Manager naming conflicts (draft proposal [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/182/)). She suggests using reverse domain names to fully quality packages, for example `import org.sadun.SwiftString`. Max Howell's [initial response](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160222/000290.html) was positive. 😎

### Finally

And finally &mdash; if you didn't know, the [try! Swift conference](http://www.tryswiftconf.com/en) is happening this week in Tokyo. Huge thanks to [@NatashaTheRobot](https://twitter.com/NatashaTheRobot) and the organizers for putting together such a great event. 🙌 Lots of familiar faces from the community are here, and it has been awesome. You can follow the fun on Twitter at [#tryswiftconf](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tryswiftconf). I even got to [meet Ash Furrow](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires/status/705034656987484160). 😂
