### News and community

Xcode 11.4 beta is out with Swift 5.2, which has a ton of compiler performance and quality of life improvements, including the new diagnostic engine, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/1225148705814106112) [Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter).

[Cory Benfield](https://twitter.com/Lukasaoz) released [Swift Crypto](https://github.com/apple/swift-crypto) at [dotSwift](https://www.dotswift.io/) conference [stage](https://twitter.com/NicoonGuitar/status/1224376366092767233). He wrote an [article](https://swift.org/blog/crypto/) on the Swift.org website. As well some folks started a [discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/native-implementations-and-boringssl-backed-apple-platform-deployments/33404).

> Swift Crypto is a new Swift package that brings the fantastic APIs of [Apple CryptoKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cryptokit) to the wider Swift community. This will allow Swift developers, regardless of the platform on which they deploy their applications, to access these APIs for a common set of cryptographic operations.

Apple released [Swift Playgrounds for Mac](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=02122020a) - making it fun to learn and experiment with code. Previously it was available only for iPad.

The release of Swift 5.1.4 for Linux was [announced](https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-swift-5-1-4-for-linux/33443). New downloads are available on [swift.org](https://swift.org/download/#swift-514). Official Docker images are also available.
Later [Johannes Weiss](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss) [informed](https://forums.swift.org/t/development-open-for-swift-5-1-5-for-linux/33744) that development is now open for Swift 5.1.5 for Linux.

[Ole Begemann](https://twitter.com/olebegemann) wrote two great articles. One about [automatic test discovery in Swift on Linux](https://oleb.net/2020/swift-test-discovery/) and another on [how to test Swift packages on Linux using Docker](https://oleb.net/2020/swift-docker-linux/).

[Antoine van der Lee](https://twitter.com/twannl) explained in his [blog post](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/creating-swift-package-manager-framework/) how to create the Swift Package framework in Xcode.

[The Point-Free](https://twitter.com/pointfreeco) folks [announced](https://twitter.com/pointfreeco/status/1224742851537514497) a library called [CasePaths](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths) that brings the power and ergonomics of key paths to enums.

[Alejandro tweeted](https://twitter.com/aalonso128/status/1224694162055999493) that Swift nightly builds are now available on [swift.godbolt.org](https://swift.godbolt.org/). Godbolt is a compiler explorer tool.

[Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1225207234185121793) that [whatsnewinswift.com](https://www.whatsnewinswift.com/?from=5.1&to=5.2) now covers Swift 5.2 and other changes between the versions.
Along with that, he released a tool called [Sitrep](https://github.com/twostraws/Sitrep) that is a source code analyzer for Swift projects, giving you a high-level overview of your code.

[Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) wrote two awesome articles about [Language Server Protocol](https://nshipster.com/language-server-protocol/) and [Swift Development with Visual Studio Code](https://nshipster.com/vscode/).

### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29579) that fixes `computeSelfParam()` to respect `__consuming` on class methods.

He also [tweeted](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/1223394327340019717):

> Dodged an ABI bullet here. Underscored keyword was broken... but thankfully the broken case wasn’t exercised in the standard library

[Tim](https://github.com/tbkka) opened [a pull request] that overhauls `swift_dynamicCast`. [David Smith](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/1225136680039899136):

> Swift's runtime casting infrastructure has been… "scary and organic" I guess? For quite a while. This rewrites it to be properly structured, and cleans up a ton of edge case behavior in the process.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29786) which adds function builders support for declaring local variables within a function builder closure.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26975) where he and [CodaFi](https://twitter.com/CodaFi_) were able to fix the remaining cases where name lookup in imported types would force loading _all_ the members of a type or extension in order to find a _single_ member.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29728) that makes it easy to extend Swift function builders to support local `let`'s.

> Sink the constraint generation and solution application of initialization patterns, including all
of the logic for property wrappers, from the high-level entry point
`typeCheckBinding` down into the lower-level handling for
solution application targets.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0270](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0270-rangeset-and-collection-operations.md): *Add Collection Operations on Noncontiguous Elements* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0270-add-collection-operations-on-noncontiguous-elements/33270). See the discussions [here](https://forums.swift.org/t/evolution-process-discussion/33272).

> We can use a `Range<Index>` to refer to a group of consecutive positions in a collection, but the standard library doesn't currently provide a way to refer to discontiguous positions in an arbitrary collection. I propose the addition of a `RangeSet` type that can represent any number of positions, along with collection algorithms that operate on those positions.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0277](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0277-float16.md): *Float16* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0277-float16/33546).

>Introduce the `Float16` type conforming to the `BinaryFloatingPoint` and `SIMDScalar` protocols, binding the IEEE 754 *binary16* format (*aka float16, half-precision, or half*), and bridged by the compiler to the C `_Float16` type.

> Old pitch thread: [Add `Float16`](https://forums.swift.org/t/add-float16/19370).

[SE-0274](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0274-magic-file.md): *Concise magic file names* is [under a second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/re-review-se-0274-concise-magic-file-names/33171).

### Swift Forums

[Tino Heth](https://forums.swift.org/u/Tino) started an interesting [discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/jargon-acronyms-vs-accessible-language/33358) about Jargon & acronyms vs. accessible language.

> When it comes to naming, I think it's best to keep the majority in mind, and not trying to please a very small group by preferring their jargon. An expert may prefer his wording, but would certainly also understand common language easily.

[Jeffrey Macko](https://twitter.com/jeffreymacko) informed in a [forum thread](https://forums.swift.org/t/support-for-semantic-highlighting-is-moving-on-microsoft-part/33489) that support for semantic highlighting is moving on Microsoft's end.

[Matt Rips](https://forums.swift.org/u/mattrips) started a [discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/special-case-protocol-conformance-long-term-tradeoffs-for-near-term-conformance/33544) about special case protocol conformance by explaining long-term tradeoffs for near-term conformance.

> In short, the original pitch was to create a special-case, compiler-level mechanism to generate Equatable conformance for all tuples whose elements themselves conform to Equatable. The conformance would be automatic, without any means to opt-in or opt-out.
> 
> There exists a fairly wide-spread and long-standing desire to enable protocol conformance for tuples and perhaps other structural types, and especially so with respect to ubiquitous protocols, like Equatable, Comparable, Hashable and Codable. Presently, we are not in a position to facilitate custom protocol conformance as a general feature for tuples or other structural types. It is anticipated that that sort of feature will be created, eventually.

### Finally

Should a Swift library [include](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires/status/1224456344792530949) a lot of Swift code? 🤔

A small [change](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/77da6bd3a7c3c2ec02bb0f13e7341cf867cab0d3), but big [impact](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/1224537246998487040). 🙃
