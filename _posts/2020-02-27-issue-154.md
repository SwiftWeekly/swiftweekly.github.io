I've been keeping myself busy the last two weeks with exciting things going on
at work, and visiting other offices. We've also been hard at work on
preparations for the SwiftAveiro conference, which I'm co-organizing this year.

All in all, cool stuff going on!

That said, here's what kept some other people busy these past two weeks...

### Starter tasks

- [SR-12247](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-12247) [Compiler] Replace the
type alias `ModuleDecl::ImportedModule` with a dedicated struct
- [SR-12248](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-12248) [TypeChecker] `<unknown>`
diagnostic location regarding `Codable` derived conformances

### News and community

[Dmitri Gribenko](https://github.com/gribozavr) shared [the Swift and C++ interoperability manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/CppInteroperabilityManifesto.md), summarized
possible design options of this goal.

[Nate Cook](https://twitter.com/nnnnnnnn) wrote [a blog post](https://swift.org/blog/preview-package/)
on the Swift.org blog, on the newly released Standard Library Preview Package.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) wrote [a blog post](https://swift.org/blog/library-evolution/)
on the Swift.org blog, on Swift's library evolution capabilities.

[Will Lisac](https://twitter.com/wlisac) open sourced [a project](https://github.com/wlisac/swift-log-slack)
on top of `swift-log` that allows you to send logging messages to Slack.

### Commits and pull requests

[Max Desiatov](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29530),
upstreaming almost a quarter of the huge patch from the [SwiftWasm](https://github.com/swiftwasm)
team, which brings us closer to enabling WebAssembly/[WASI](https://wasi.dev/)
target in the compiler and running Swift code in browsers.

[David Smith](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24303)
that adds the new uninitialized buffer String initializer privately, improving
its performance.

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://github.com/xedin) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29906)
mostly finishing the diagnostics engine rewrite, and the people working on the
expression checker are now ready to rip out the old implementation completely!

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30045)
to add support for patterns in "if" statements for function builders, so one
can use `if-let`, `if-case`, etcetera.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0277](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0277-float16.md): *Float16* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0277-float16/34121).

> The review has concluded and the proposal is accepted.

[SE-0274](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0274-magic-file.md): *Concise magic file names* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0274-concise-magic-file-names/34115).

> The second review has concluded and the proposal has been accepted.
>
> - `#file` will be altered to only report the module and filename
> - `#filePath` will be introduced to replicate the previous full file+path for
use cases that relied on the path previously.
- While the team acknowledges that this does require some existing workflows to
adapt to the new scheme, the binary size and privacy concerns over implicitly
embedding the full path were significant enough to warrant this change.
>
> During the second review, the format of the new `#file` value was discussed
and will be locked down in a way that users can rely on. The core team expects
future tooling to be created that will allow for easy processing of this value.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0278](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0278-package-manager-localized-resources.md): *Package Manager Localized Resources* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0278-package-manager-localized-resources/33950).

> This proposal builds on top of the [Package Manager Resources](0271-package-manager-resources.md) proposal to allow defining localized versions of resources in the SwiftPM manifest and have them automatically accessible at runtime using the same APIs.

## Motivation

> The recently accepted [Package Manager Resources](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0271-package-manager-resources.md)
proposal allows SwiftPM users to define resources (images, data file, etc...)
in their manifests and have them packaged inside a bundle to be accessible at
runtime using the Foundation `Bundle` APIs. Bundles support storing different
versions of resources for different localizations and can retrieve the version
which makes most sense depending on the runtime environment, but SwiftPM
currently offers no way to define those localized variants.
>
> While it is technically possible to benefit from localization today by
setting up a resource directory structure that the `Bundle` API expects and
specifying it with a `.copy` rule in the manifest (to have SwiftPM retain the
structure), this comes at a cost: it bypasses any platform-custom processing
that comes with `.process`, and doesn't allow SwiftPM to provide diagnostics
when localized resources are mis-configured.
>
> Without a way to define localized resources, package authors are missing out
on powerful Foundation APIs to have their applications, libraries and tools
adapt to different regions and languages.

### Swift Forums

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd) shared [that Foundation's full test suite passes on Windows](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-soars-ever-higher/34036)!

> I am extremely excited to announce that as of today we have the full test
suite for Foundation passing on Windows as well! Although there are a few tests
which are testing Unix specific behaviors which do not port, this is largely on
parity with the Linux test suite. There are a total of 1706 tests on Windows
that are running with Linux currently having 1714.

[Yuta Saito](https://twitter.com/kateinoigakukun) shared [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/wasm-support/16087/14)
on the progress of the WebAssembly compiler target.

> Now that the swiftwasm project succeeds to pass quite a few tests in its test
suite, we are planning to send some patches to upstream.
>
> Before sending them, I want to confirm and clarify the direction of
supporting WebAssembly.

[Sergej Jaskiewicz](https://twitter.com/broadway_lamb) shared [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/support-building-rust-targets-in-spm/33898)
to add support for Rust targets to the Swift Package Manager.

> I've just come up with this crazy idea: what if we allow SPM to build Rust
targets?
>
>For now I have the following in mind:
>
> - Obviously, for building Rust targets the rust toolchain has to be installed.
> - We don't use Cargo for building Rust targets, but rather invoke `rustc`
directly. We could allow Swift packages to depend on Cargo packages in the
future, but that seems nontrivial.
> - Rust targets can only depend on other Rust targets. Swift or Clang targets
cannot depend on Rust targets. Why? Because it would require a lot of work.
Later we could allow Rust targets to have the "include" directory just like
Clang targets, which would contain C headers for that target so that the Rust
target could be used from Swift using those headers (just like C++ targets
today can be used from Swift via C headers).

[Gwynne Raskind](https://twitter.com/_AngeloidBeta) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/property-wrapper-requirements-in-protocols/33953)
to add property wrapper requirements in protocols.

> It is sometimes desirable for a protocol to require that a conforming type
use a property wrapper in the declaration of a required property. This allows
consumers of the protocol to access the wrapper's projected value and
properties, not just the wrapped value.
>
> We propose allowing a subset of property wrapper syntax to appear in protocol
declarations.

[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) shared [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/update-on-se-0110-and-se-0155/33948)
on SE-0110 and SE-0155.

> In the Swift 3 era, several source-breaking proposals had been accepted with
the goal of cleaning up and regularizing parts of the language. However, many
of them have been stuck in the "Accepted" but not "Implemented" stage for
quite a while now, because we never quite got , and the barrier for breaking
source compatibility is much higher now than it was in the heady early days of
Swift evolution. As such, the Core Team has started going through some of these
proposals to record their current implementation status and subset out
remaining unimplemented source-breaking changes. To start off, I recently
reviewed the implementation status of two proposals:
>
> - [SE-0110](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0110-distingish-single-tuple-arg.md), Distinguish between single-tuple and multiple-argument function types
> - [SE-0155](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0155-normalize-enum-case-representation.md), Normalize Enum Case Representation
>
> **SE-0110**
>
> This proposal changed the behavior of functions with multiple arguments from
being considered to have one formal argument of tuple type to instead be
treated as formally having multiple arguments. This change has been fully
implemented as of Swift 5.2; however, the [original proposal as reviewed](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/9e44932452e1daead98f2bc2e58711eb489e9751/proposals/0110-distingish-single-tuple-arg.md)
did not include the special-case conversion from `(T, U, ...) -> V` to
`((T, U, ...)) -> V` for function arguments. In response to community feedback,
this conversion was added as part of the Core Team's acceptance of the proposal.
> If and when that happens, it will be done as a fresh pitch and proposal.
>
> **SE-0155**
>
> Although unfortunate, the Core Team does not consider it worth breaking
source compatibility to change this behavior. Therefore, the pattern matching
part of the proposal has been downscoped to allow for disambiguation when
multiple cases share a base name, without changing the behavior for existing
enums supported today.

[Reda Lemeden](https://twitter.com/kaishin) asked [a question](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-package-naming-conventions/33931)
about Swift Package naming conventions.

> - Some packages use dash-case (aka kebab-case). Notable examples:
`swift-driver`, `swift-numerics`, `swift-log`, `swift-crypto`, and `swift-nio`.
Other that fall into this group are SSWG packages and the new standard library
preview packages.
> - Some packages use CamelCase. Notable examples: `SwiftPM` itself,
`SourceKitLSP`, and `SwiftSyntax`. Almost all iOS/macOS packages follow this
convention.
>
> I understand if this detail is considered trivial or irrelevant, especially
since package names play a much lesser role compared to other package managers
such as npm. It is also worth noting that this situation is not unique to SPM
and can be found in other ecosystems, such as Rust, where `snake_cased` and
`dash-cased` crate names are both widely used (although the latter is gaining
more momentum).
>
> At the same time, I think that with the eventual introduction of a package
registry (GitHub's or otherwise), these naming inconsistencies are going to
surface to the end user much more than they do today.
>
> Is the absence of SPM package naming guidelines by design? If so, can someone
shed some light on this?
> If it is not, would it make sense to pursue converging towards one
convention? Could it happen organically or should it be enforced on the
manifest level?
