This week in Swift development: the Swift team created several fun new starter
tasks, Doug Gregor fixed a nasty bug in Objective-C interop, and the mailing
lists were abuzz with several exciting Swift Evolution proposals. Adjust your
Apple Watches -- it's "Swift Weekly Brief O'Clock"!

### Starter tasks

* [SR-6264](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6264): This task is to extract
  duplicated code in three methods. The methods each check whether a declaration
  may be used externally based on its access level (`public`, `internal`, etc.).
* [SR-6272](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6272): This task is to add better
  diagnostics for common numerical conversions. For example, the Swift compiler
  should be able to suggest a cast for source code that attempts to multiply an
  `Int` and a `CGFloat`.
* [SR-6312](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6312): To clone the apple/swift
  family of projects, and to pull in the latest changes to those clones,
  contributors use a Python script: `utils/update-checkout --clone` to clone,
  and just `utils/update-checkout` to update. This task is to modify
  `utils/update-checkout` so that it suggests using `--clone` if the user
  attempts to update before cloning.

If you're looking for a meatier task, you may want to try
[SR-3423](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3423), which would allow enum cases
with tuple raw values. In other words, you could make this possible in Swift:

{% highlight swift %}
enum Status: (Int, String) {
  case OK = (200, "OK")
  case NotFound = (404, "Not Found")
}
{% endhighlight %}

### News and community

[Arek Holko](https://twitter.com/arekholko) [posted](https://github.com/fastred/Optimizing-Swift-Build-Times)
a checklist for diagnosing and improving long compile times in Swift projects.

[Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache) continued his Swift compiler series with
[*An Introduction to the Swift Compiler Driver*](https://modocache.io/introduction-to-the-swift-compiler-driver).

### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12823)
an issue in which Swift's ClangImporter would use a stale AST cache for
properties of Objective-C classes, which affected how declarations would be
imported into Swift. This most likely fixes an issue in which
`-[UIView addGestureRecognizer:]` would sometimes be imported as
`UIView.add(_:)`.

[John McCall](https://twitter.com/pathofshrines) [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12789)
a way to represent coroutines in Swift's intermediate language, SIL.

[Daniel Dunbar](https://twitter.com/daniel_dunbar) opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild/pull/195)
that improves the cancellation model in llbuild. Previously, cancelling a build
in llbuild would not stop work that was in-flight, but instead merely have those
units of work finish normally and then report a "cancelled" status. The change
cancels the work, preventing it from completing as it normally would.

[Mark Lacey](https://github.com/rudkx) opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12682)
to fix edge cases in which implicitly-unwrapped optional (IUO) usage that was
disallowed by [SE-0054](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0054-abolish-iuo.md)
was considered valid in Swift 3 and 4. This is a "source-breaking" change for
codebases that used syntax that, while being technically invalid in Swift 3 and
4, would not result in errors being emitted by the Swift compiler until now.
He also opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/1306)
that removes a soon-to-be-disallowed IUO from swift-corelibs-foundation.

[Philippe Hausler](https://twitter.com/phausler) opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/1305)
to update swift-corelibs-foundation with the latest CoreFoundation source code
included in macOS High Sierra.

[Francis Ricci](https://github.com/fjricci) opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12702)
that allows Objective-C to be imported even on non-Darwin platforms. Although
I would imagine almost no developers use an Objective-C runtime outside of
Darwin, this does decouple some ClangImporter behavior from its host platform,
which seems like a good thing to do.

### Proposals in review

The [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-November/000406.html)
of _[SE-0187](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0187-introduce-filtermap.md):
Introduce `Sequence.filterMap(_:)`_ has begun and runs through November 14th, 2017.

> We propose to deprecate the controversial version of a `Sequence.flatMap`
  method and provide the same functionality under a different, and potentially
  more descriptive, name. [...] The name being `filterMap(_:)` as we believe it
  best describes the intent of this function. [...] Since the old function will
  still be available (although deprecated) all the existing code will compile,
  producing a deprecation warning and a fix-it.

The [review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-November/000407.html)
of _[SE-0188](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0188-stdlib-index-types-hashable.md):
Make stdlib index types `Hashable`_ begins now and runs through November 14th, 2017.

> This proposal would add `Hashable` conformance to all the index types in the
  standard library. With that done, `[Int]`, `String`, and all other standard
  libary collections would have the same behavior when using subscripts in key
  paths.

### Mailing lists

Tony Parker [solicited](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171106/040959.html)
public feedback on a Foundation-only proposal that has been evaluated internally
at Apple. The proposal is for a mechanism to encode and decode JSON keys in
order to, for example, automatically deserialize `snake_case_keys` as
`camelCaseKeys`.

[Dave DeLong](https://twitter.com/davedelong) [proposed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171030/040862.html)
allowing custom operators to take parameters with default arguments. He also
provided an implementation with the proposal.

Ben Cohen [pitched](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171106/041053.html)
eliminating `IndexDistance` from `Collection`. He [tweeted](https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift/status/928376958357876736)
that it would make writing generic algorithms easier.

Alejandro Alonso [proposed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170904/039605.html)
adding standard library functions for generating random numbers, as well as for
randomizing the order of an array ("shuffling"). The proposal aims to address
a pain point in cross-platform Swift development, since different platforms
use different randomization functions (`arc4random()` on Darwin, `random()` or
`rand()` on Linux, etc.).

[Jacob Bandes-Storch](https://twitter.com/jtbandes) [re-proposed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171106/040950.html)
adding an `allCases` static property to enums. The proposal was widely popular
when it was first proposed for Swift 3, but ultimately deferred. If it's
accepted this time, we may see it in Swift 5.

Discussion of [Graydon Hoare](https://twitter.com/graydon_pub)'s Swift Evolution
[proposal draft](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171023/040652.html),
which adds a target environment platform condition to the Swift language,
continues. The patch proposes adding a `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)`
condition. Replies to the proposal began to discuss what attributes should be
available as platform conditions. This week, Graydon [pointed out](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171030/040819.html)
that whether the compilation target was a simulator or not was encoded in the
target triple, a decision made recently in LLVM, so discussions of whether it
should be encoded at all should be done on the LLVM mailing lists.

[Brent Royal-Gordon](https://twitter.com/brentdax) [asked](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171030/040863.html)
about how he could update his once deferred proposal, [SE-0132](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0132-sequence-end-ops.md),
which proposes renaming several `Sequence` and `Collection` methods such that
they follow a consistent naming scheme.

Erik Eckstein [proposed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20171030/005774.html)
deprecating the `-Ounchecked` compiler option. This optimization mode removes
runtime safety checks, and adds additional complexity to the standard library
code, which must behave differently at that optimization level.

[Rick Ballard](https://twitter.com/rballard) [responded](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171106/040953.html)
to questions about SwiftPM's roadmap for Swift 5.

Kelvin Ma [pointed out](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20171106/005811.html)
that Swift has potential to layout some enums using fewer bytes.

### Finally

Did you [remember](https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/926911250507993088) to adjust for DST? (That's "delightful Swift time", of course.)
