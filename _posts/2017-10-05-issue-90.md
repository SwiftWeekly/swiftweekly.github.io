It's been a while since I last wrote an issue, but I am glad to be writing another one. Especially after meeting JP at [FrenchKit](http://frenchkit.fr) where we both gave a talk (JP did one on profiling Swift performance on Linux ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jpsim/performance-profiling-swift-on-linux)), I did one on what we can expect from Swift 5 ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/basthomas/whats-up-with-swift-5))). There will be videos, but we'll have to wait a little longer for those.

Other than that, we are now less than a month away from the iPhone X! That means upgrading your apps sooner rather than later. 

Have a great week!

### Starter tasks

There's a starter task to [check if a given map file exists when passing it as an argument](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6055).

### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 31](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/88491) Jesse and JP discuss compile times, looking at the ways you can profile and improve your compile times and some discussions on the mailing lists regarding the topic.

### News and community

Apple [open sourced](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/915653994176954368) their CoreML tools - and they're open to contributions. 😱

The Swift HTTP server v0.1.0 is now [available](https://twitter.com/Chris__Bailey/status/914925288240316416)! Go try it out and leave some feedback!

Chris Bailey [checked the speed](https://github.com/swift-server/which_is_the_fastest) of the various Swift HTTP frameworks to check "which is the fastest?".

Nate Cook [wrote a blogpost](https://swift.org/blog/dictionary-and-set-improvements/) on the official Swift.org blog talking about the improvements (like [SE-0165](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0165-dict.md) and [SE-0154](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0154-dictionary-key-and-value-collections.md)) made in `Dictionary` and `Set` in Swift 4. It contains some great examples (with emoji 👌).

Ted Kremenek is [looking for someone](https://twitter.com/tkremenek/status/915229686740926465) to help him with project management on Swift. Maybe it's you he's looking for?! 🏎

Slava Pestov shared that Swift's 5 goal of ABI stability also means he's also [able to do some cleanup](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/915110709209456640) because of it. 💪

Doug Gregor's improvements on generics sped up the type checking phase of the standard library [by a whopping 300%](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/914594813697130496)! 

### Commits and pull requests

Kelvin Ma [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12200) that has an implementation for his [proposal](https://github.com/kelvin13/swift-evolution/blob/improved-pointers/proposals/0184a-unsafe-pointers-part-1.md). This implements part of the original proposal, [SE-0184](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0184-unsafe-pointers-add-missing.md).

Doug Gregor [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11923) one of the two proposals required for ABI stability, [SE-0157: *Support recursive constraints on associated types*](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0157-recursive-protocol-constraints.md). In the process, that [removed more than 600 lines of code](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/914729705827209216) in the standard library that were not needed anymore. [1 to go](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0143-conditional-conformances.md)!

Roman Levenstein [made some progress](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12191) on ABI stability - as well as cleaning up the compiler. 😎

Jordan Rose [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/751) on `swift-evolution` to add non-exhaustive enums to Swift. It (obviously?) includes an [implementation](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11961) too. Read [the pitch](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170807/038663.html) for this proposal on the mailing lists.

Slava Pestov [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12174) that fixes a one and a half year old [bug](https://bugs.swift.org/login.jsp?os_destination=%2Fplugins%2Fservlet%2Fmobile%23issue%2FSR-617) related to the use of `Self` and `self`.

Robert Widmann [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11869) to diagnose infinite recursion (recursion, recursion), fixing four SR-bugs in the process.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0186](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0186-remove-ownership-keyword-support-in-protocols.md): *Remove ownership keyword support in protocols* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-September/000404.html).

> Feedback for the proposal — which many interpreted as being mostly a compiler bug fix — was limited but unanimously positive. The consensus was that removing the support for these ownership keywords in protocols removes false expectations on their behavior, which could be a source of bugs.

### Mailing lists

Chris Lattner sent out an email discussing a metaproposal - a proposal on a proposal - to tackle [refining identifier and operator symbology](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170925/040009.html).

> [The proposal](https://github.com/xwu/swift-evolution/blob/7c2c4df63b1d92a1677461f41bc638f31926c9c3/proposals/NNNN-refining-identifier-and-operator-symbology.md) correctly observes that the partitioning of unicode codepoints into identifiers and operators is a mess in some cases. It really is an outright bug for 🙂 to be an identifier, but ☹️ to be an operator. That said, the proposal itself is complicated and is defined in terms of a bunch of unicode classes that may evolve in the “wrong way for Swift” in the future.
>
> The core team would really like to get this sorted out for Swift 5.
>
> To make progress on this, we suggest a few separable steps:
>
> First, please split out the changes to the ASCII characters to its own proposal [..]
>
> Second, someone should take a look at the concrete set of unicode identifiers that are accepted by Swift 4 and write a new proposal that splits them into the three groups: those that are clearly identifiers (which become identifiers), those that are clearly operators (which become operators), and those that are unclear or don’t matter (these become invalid code points).
>
> Third, if there is interest sometime in the future, we can have subsequent proposals that expand the range of accepted code points, motivated by the specific application domain that cares about them. These proposals will not be source breaking, so they can happen at any time.
