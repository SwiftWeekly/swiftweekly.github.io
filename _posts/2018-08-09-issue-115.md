A calm week during these warm two summer weeks. Nevertheless, here is a quick update on what has happened these weeks.

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-8467](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8467) [Compiler] Invalid read when calling `swift::AnyFunctionType::getExtInfo`
- [SR-8464](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8464) [Compiler] Attempting to print a function should require the use of `String(describing:)`
- [SR-8453](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8453) [Compiler] Warn when redundant access modifier is added in an extension

### Swift Unwrapped

While Jesse and JP are on a holiday break from the podcast, you can find all previous episodes [here](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped).

### News and community

[Nicole Jacque](https://forums.swift.org/u/nicole_jacque/summary) shared that [Swift 4.1.3](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-4-1-3-is-released-linux-only/14847), with a [Linux-only fix](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7650), has been released.

### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/18145) getting rid of redundancy in protocol derivation.

[Philippe Hausler](https://github.com/phausler) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/18469) to fix ambiguous mapping to `Data` from a byte sequence in Swift 4.2.

[David Hart](https://twitter.com/dhartbit) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/1537) that allows SwiftPM to use `llbuild` as a library, which will "enable great new features and enhancements in the future".

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://github.com/xedin) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/18484) to emit diagnostics directly from the constraint solver, moving away from re-type checking sub-expressions after a failure, which has been a source of misleading diagnostics and crashes.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0221](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0221-character-properties.md): *Character Properties* was [accepted with pending discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-pending-discussion-se-0221-character-properties/14944).

> SE-0221 has been accepted, with the exception of the `.isEmoji` property.
>
> The core team accepts the principle for the `isEmoji` property, but wants to continue the discussion of exactly how it should work. Therefore the thread will remain open for this specific topic through **August 10th**. The other functionality can be merged into master in the meantime.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0220](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0220-count-where.md): *`count(where:)`* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0220-count-where/15048).

> While Swift's `Sequence` models brings a lot of niceties that we didn't have access to in Objective-C, like `map` and `filter`, there are other useful operations on sequences that the standard library doesn't support yet. One current missing operation is  `count(where:)`, which counts the number of elements in a `Sequence` that pass some test.

[SE-0222](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0222-lazy-compactmap-sequence.md): *Lazy CompactMap Sequence* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0222-lazy-compactmap-sequence/14850).

> Chaining multiple `.map()`s and `.filter()`s on a lazy collection leads to suboptimal codegen, as well as large, painful type names.
>
> To improve this, we propose adding a `LazyCompactMap{Sequence, Collection}` type along with some overloads on the other lazy collection types' `.map(_:)` and `.filter(_:)` functions which return this type to get better codegen and shorter type names.

### Swift Forums

[Becca Royal-Gordon](http://twitter.com/beccadax) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/draft-fix-string-interpolation-swift-5-edition/14786) to fix String interpolation in Swift 5.

> String interpolation is a simple and powerful feature for expressing complex, runtime-created strings, but the current version of the `ExpressibleByStringInterpolation` protocol has been deprecated since Swift 3. We propose a new design which improves its performance, clarity, and efficiency.

[Erica Sadun](http://twitter.com/ericasadun/status/970754573609484288) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/support-repeating-initializers-with-closures-not-just-values/14666) to support repeating initializers with closures.

> I'd like to pitch a protocol that supports repeated initializers, both for a repeated element and for `() -> Element`. The goal is to ensure that any type that conforms to the protocol guarantees that if you can initialize with _n_ copies of a value type, then you can initialize with _n_ instances of a reference type or _n_ applications of a closure:

{% highlight swift %}
protocol RepeatingInitializable: Collection {
  
  /// See also: `Repeat.swift`: A collection whose elements are all identical.
  /// https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/stdlib/public/core/Repeat.swift
  public init(repeating repeatedValue: Element, count: Int)
  
  /// Allow reference types to generate new instances and value types
  /// to use a closure to create potentially distinct values
  ///
  /// A collection whose elements are all created by an identical generator
  public init(repeating repeatedGenerator: @autoclosure () -> Element, count: Int)
}
{% endhighlight %}
