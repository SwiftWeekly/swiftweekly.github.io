Welcome to issue #24! As noted last week, the first Swift 3 preview branch was cut and now there's a [Swift 3.0 Preview 1](https://github.com/apple/swift/milestones/Swift%203.0%20Preview%201) milestone on GitHub tracking pull requests to be included. Currently there are 60 closed and 4 open.

Swift is about to hit another important milestone &mdash; 100 proposals. As of this writing there have been 99 [Swift evolution proposals](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals) merged into the repository, many of them from the community. Swift has only been open source for about 6 months, so that's over 16 proposals per month &mdash; nearly one proposal every other day! I'm pretty sure coordinating, reviewing, and writing swift-evolution announcement emails is Chris Lattner's new ["nights and weekends" passion](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/674254974629502976). 😉

Thus, last week's [announcement](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160516/017701.html) about the goals of Swift 3 really should not have been a surprise. I think [Dave Verwer](http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/251#start) said it best, *"It’s likely that this volume of high quality community input came as a surprise to the Swift team. Certainly, if it was still closed source, the scope and features of Swift 3 would have been different."*

 In other news, Apple released new betas for [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=05232016c), [tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=05232016b), and [OS X](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=0232016a).

### Accepted proposals

Matt Wright's proposal, [SE-0088](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0088-libdispatch-for-swift3.md): *Modernize libdispatch for Swift 3 naming conventions*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000163.html) **with revisions** for Swift 3.

> The community and core team are both very positive about this massive improvement to the libdispatch APIs.  Much of the discussion has centered around specific details in the proposal - for example the “.asynchronously” method on `DispatchQueue`.  This great discussion leads to several requested revisions in the proposal:
>
> - Rename the `DispatchQueue.[a]synchronously` methods to `.async` and `.sync`, to follow the term of art.
> - Rename `DispatchIO` `setHighWater`, `setLowWater` --> `setLimit(highWater:)`, `setLimit(lowWater:)`
> - Rename `setTargetQueue(queue:)` and `DispatchSource.setTimer`
> - Rename Semaphore, Group and WorkItem: `.wait(timeout:)` --> `wait()` and `wait(withTimeout:)`
> - Expand source handler methods to take the same arguments as `async()`
> - Expand `DispatchQueue.after` to take the same arguments as `async()` in addition to the `when:` argument
>
> Thank you to Matt Wright proposing this, and for all of the implementation work that has gone into this so far!

Kevin Ballard's and Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0094](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0094-sequence-function.md): *Add `sequence(initial:next:)` and `sequence(state:next:)` to the stdlib*, was [reviewed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000162.html) and [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000170.html) **with revisions** for Swift 3.

> - Feedback from the community & core team is positive.
> - Core team discussed whether it made sense to add just the first form, or whether it made sense to add both.  They agree that although the form using an explicit state is much more infrequently used, when it is necessary, it is extremely helpful to have.  It is also useful to consider both as a pair.
> - On naming, the core team agrees with the community that `sequence(first:next:)` is a better name than `sequence(initial:next:)`.  `sequence(state:next:)` is approved as-is.

### Amended proposals

Proposal [SE-0022](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0022-objc-selectors.md): *Referencing the Objective-C selector of a method* has been [amended](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000164.html). You can find the diff [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/1dfd6cd4fc2e9874d5db8aef6a5f41d6556b2ca2).

> Alex Hoppen, who undertook the work to implement the related proposal [SE-0064](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0064-property-selectors.md), "Referencing the Objective-C selector of property getters and setters", noted that by accepting arbitrary expressions inside a `#selector` expression, we made it difficult to handle the getter and setter selector cases introduced by [SE-0064](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0064-property-selectors.md). It was not the original proposal's attempt to accept arbitrary expressions, only expressions that happened to form a valid method reference, and the amendment seeks to clarify this intent.

### Deferred proposals

Nate Cook's and Sergey Bolshedvorsky's proposal, [SE-0078](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0078-rotate-algorithm.md): *Implement a rotate algorithm, equivalent to `std::rotate()` in C++*, was [deferred](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000165.html) from Swift 3.

> The general “rotate a collection by N elements” operation is a powerful operation that is nice to have in certain domains, but also has very narrow applicability.  Further, the proposal has high implementation complexity (particularly when dealing with lazy collections) due to missing generics features like constrained extensions.  As such, the core team has decided to defer this feature until the dependent generics features are available.
>
> One specific exception to this deferral is the `reverse()` algorithm proposed for `BidirectionalCollection`. This algorithm is simple and straight-forward, so it is approved for Swift 3.

Joe Groff's proposal, [SE-0083](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0083-remove-bridging-from-dynamic-casts.md): *Remove bridging conversion behavior from dynamic casts*, was [deferred](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000173.html) for **re-evaluation later in Swift 3**.

> The core team and much of the community would like to get the predictability wins of this proposal.  However, recent experience with the fallout of "[SE-0072](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0072-eliminate-implicit-bridging-conversions.md): Fully eliminate implicit bridging conversions from Swift” has raised some concerns that it may have overly harmed Objective-C APIs designed around the “id” type.  Joe Groff will be investigating a few ideas that may help make SE-0072 work better in practice, and until they are explored and understood, the core team prefers to defer discussion on SE-0083.
>
> Once we have clarity on the fate of SE-0072 (in the next 3-6 weeks), we can discuss SE-0083 again.  Thank you to Joe Groff for this proposal, and also for helping to sort out the issues related to SE-0072.

Joe Groff's and Tanner Nelson's proposal, [SE-0090](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0090-remove-dot-self.md): *Remove `.self` and freely allow type references in expressions*, was [deferred](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000174.html) from Swift 3.

> The community and core team all want this proposal (or something like it) to succeed, but the core team identified several serious implementation concerns with the proposal:
>
> - Disambiguating type vs expression cannot be done in cases where there is no contextual type available or when that type is `Any`.  For example, in the case of `let x = [Int]` it isn't clear whether this is an array value that contains the metatype for `Int`, or whether it is a metatype value for the type `[Int]`.  Similar problems exist with tuple literals, including the degenerate case of `let x = ()` which can either be the type of the empty tuple type or an empty tuple value.
> - As written, the proposal has a defaulting rule that fall back to the container literal when a type literal cannot be formed.  The core team prefers that the compiler treat truly ambiguous cases (where a subexpression could be considered to be either a type or a value) to be ambiguous.
> - Resolving ambiguous cases requires some syntax to disambiguate between the cases, which we don’t have.  This syntax should be part of the proposal.
> - Having the constraint solver determine whether a subexpression is in a type or expression context is conceptually beautiful, but it introduces significant complexity into the type checker and puts more pressure onto the constraint solver.  The core team would prefer to see the already planned optimizations and simplifications go into the constraint solver before this happens.  This would allow us to more accurately gauge the cost of this design in practice.
> - The goal of removing the `Int.self` syntax is a great one, but can be done at any point (beyond Swift 3) at little cost: the goal is to obsolete the `T.self` syntax, not to repurpose it to mean something else.  This means that we can continue to accept it as deprecated syntax for a very long time with little cost to the community.
>
> The core team would definitely like to circle back to this proposal after Swift 3 is out the door, but would recommend that such a proposal be accompanied with a prototype implementation, to validation that the chosen approach can work in practice.

### Returned proposals

Austin Zheng's proposal, [SE-0089](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0089-rename-string-reflection-init.md): *Renaming `String.init<T>(_: T)`*, was [returned](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000175.html) for revision.

> The proposal has been *returned for revision* and another round of discussion - the core team would love to see the revised proposal make it into Swift 3.
>
> The community and core team both want to remove this "footgun" from the standard library, where someone could write "String(x)" with the intention of getting a value-preserving conversion to String, but may instead get a potentially lossy and potentially expensive reflection-based conversion to a String.  After extensive discussion, the core team recommends that the community consider a somewhat more elaborate design...

### Rejected Proposals

Proposal [SE-0084](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0084-trailing-commas.md): *Allow trailing commas in parameter lists and tuples* was [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000171.html).

> The feedback from the community was quite divided on this topic...
>
> Swift currently accepts a trailing comma in array and dictionary collection literals, for three reasons:  evolution of a project often adds and removes elements to the collection over time, these changes do not alter the type of the collection (so those changes are typically spot changes), and the closing sigil of the collection (a right square bracket) is often placed on the line *following* the elements of the collection.  Because of these properties, accepting a trailing comma in a collection literal can help reduce spurious diffs when elements are added or removed.
>
> That said, these properties do not translate to other comma separated lists in Swift...

Proposal [SE-0087](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0087-lazy-attribute.md): *Rename `lazy` to `@lazy`* was [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000172.html).

> The community feedback on this proposal was that the most important thing was for the syntax to align with that of the forthcoming property behavior syntax.  The core team does not know what that syntax will be, so it prefers to reject this proposal. [...] ...it would be worse to switch “lazy” to “@lazy” in Swift 3, only to switch it to something else in a subsequent release.

### Proposals in review

Adrian Zubarev's and Austin Zheng's proposal, [SE-0095](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0095-any-as-existential.md): *Replace `protocol<P1,P2>` syntax with `Any<P1,P2>`*, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000166.html). Aside from the positive implications for generics, I think this is a great change to bring further consistency to the language. Repurposing the `protocol` keyword for composition always felt awkward and out of place to me. The community feedback on this proposal is positive so far, and Joe Groff has [started some bikeshedding](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160523/018791.html) on an alternative form of infix syntax for composing constraints.

> A stated goal for Swift 3.0 is making breaking changes to prepare the way for features to be introduced in future features, especially those involving the enhancements to the generics system detailed in [*Completing Generics*](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md).
>
> One such change described in *Completing Generics* is renaming `protocol<>` to `Any<>` in order to allow it to serve as a syntactic foundation for more generalized existential types. This is a straightforward change which will allow a later version of Swift to introduce better handling for existential types without making breaking changes, or changes whose functionality overlaps with that of existing features.

Erica Sadun has three proposals under review this week.

- [SE-0097](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0097-negative-attributes.md): *Normalizing naming for "negative" attributes* is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000167.html). *"This proposal normalizes naming for "negative" attributes by adopting a rule that replaces property names starting with `no` with adjectives starting with `non`."* So far there's limited and mixed feedback from the community. I'm rather neutral on this.

- [SE-0098](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0098-didset-capitalization.md): *Lowercase `didSet` and `willSet` for more consistent keyword casing* is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000168.html). There's mixed feedback from the community on this one, mostly leaning *against* the change. It seems like Joe Groff's [concern](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160523/018779.html) over potential language churn has shifted opinions: *"`didSet` and `willSet` are already contextual rather than formal keywords, and there's a conceivable future where `didSet` and `willSet` are no longer keywords at all if we run with the 'property behaviors' feature again in the future. If we think that's likely, I'm not sure this intermediate churn is really worth it."*

- [SE-0096](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0096-dynamictype.md): *Converting `dynamicType` from a property to an operator* is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-May/000169.html). There's positive support for this change from the community.

> In Swift, `dynamicType` is a property. Because of that, it shows up as an "appropriate" code completion for all values regardless of whether it makes sense to do so or not. For example, Swift offers `4.dynamicType` and `myFunction().dynamicType`, etc. Unlike most properties, it does not express a logical attribute of a specific type. Instead, it can be applied to any expression. Since `dynamicType` behaves more like a operator (like `sizeof`), its user-facing calling syntax should follow suit.

### Mailing lists

Brian Gesiak [shared](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160516/000662.html) the new swift-corelibs-xctest [JIRA dashboard](https://bugs.swift.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10408) that he created. 🙇

> If you're like me, you might be curious how Core Libraries like swift-corelibs-xctest are doing with regards to the looming Swift 3.0 release. Well, wonder no more... [...] The dashboard not only lists tasks that need to be resolved by Swift 3.0, but also open starter tasks for new contributors.

Following Brian's lead, [Daniel Dunbar](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160523/000664.html) announced a [dashboard](https://bugs.swift.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10409) for SwiftPM. [Brian](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160523/000670.html) also created a [dashboard](https://bugs.swift.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10410) for corelibs-foundation and Philippe Hausler [added](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160523/000671.html) a bunch of starter tasks. Each of these dashboards make it super easy to manage tasks and discover starter tasks. 👏

### Finally

And finally &mdash; "Yes, it’s true: with a little tuning, [C can be just as fast as Swift](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/734992912581169152)." 😂 (Great article from [Matt Gallagher](http://www.cocoawithlove.com/blog/2016/05/19/random-numbers.html) this week.)
