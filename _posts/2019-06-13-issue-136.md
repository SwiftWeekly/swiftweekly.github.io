So that was quite the week, wasn't it? So many interesting things announced at
WWDC. Although there were no groundbreaking announcements regarding Swift 6 or
the open source projects, but with SwiftUI, iPadOS, ~~Marzipan~~ Catalyst, and
more, the one word to sum up WWDC for me was
[overwhelming](https://twitter.com/basthomas/status/1137284397617623040). In
a good way, though!

Looking forward to the amazing things we'll all get to do with these
announcements next. And if we're lucky, we might even get to see some of the
tools in open source and/or on other platforms... Here's hoping.

With all of that happening, it has been relatively (read: very) quiet when it
comes to proposals, although a few updates to proposals related to the new
announcements are underway, so expect updates in two weeks!

contributing to the Swift Compiler.

### News and community

Apple introduced a new framework,
[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), that brings a declarative
user interface builder to all Apple platforms. Now to wait for them to open
source it! ðŸ¤ž

[an article](https://medium.com/@suyash.srijan/intro-to-swiftui-part-1-47361a3ffb2e)
on the language features of Swift that power SwiftUI.

### Swift Forums

[John McCall](https://twitter.com/pathofshrines) pitched
[a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-function-builders/25167) for
Function Builders.

> It's always been a goal of Swift to support declarative programming, and the
language can be quite good for it, but some kinds of "declaration" fit better
into the current language than others. In particular, heterogeneous trees with
a lot of hard-coded structure â€” such as JSON, HTML, and view hierarchies â€”
often feel a bit awkward to express using the ordinary tools of the language.
I think we can do better than that, and so I'm proposing a feature to enable a
new class of embedded DSL in Swift.

You can read the draft proposal
[here](https://github.com/rjmccall/swift-evolution/blob/function-builders/proposals/XXXX-function-builders.md).

[Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) also shared
[an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/important-evolution-discussion-of-the-new-dsl-feature-behind-swiftui/25168)
on the pitch above.

> Those of you watching Apple's WWDC keynote today and introduction of SwiftUI
likely observed a new enhancement to the Swift language in the form a Domain
Specific Language
([DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) that could be
used to build a UI in code.
>
> This is a feature that has not been discussed on Swift evolution. The work on
that feature has been very iterative with lots of experimentation. Those of us
involved in that work wanted to make sure we had a design we were happy with
before taking it back for discussion with the community. Further, while the
feature is general purpose, adding it to Swift is easier to motivate and
discuss the details with a compelling and concrete use case like SwiftUI.
>
> Speaking on behalf of the Core Team, here are the next steps to discuss and
review the feature:
>
> - The Core Team would like to run a formal review of the feature soon.
> - Before that review, we'd like to use the pitch thread for general
discussion and questions about the feature.
>
> While Apple has embraced the approach as part of SwiftUI, the evolution
review is intended to have a real and tangible impact on the shape of the
feature itself.

[Nathan Harris](https://twitter.com/Mordil) shared
[a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/feedback-redisnio-a-nio-based-redis-driver/25521)
for a NIO-based Redis Driver.

> **RedisNIO** is a module providing general implementations for connecting to
a Redis instance and executing commands against it using Redis' proprietary
[**Re**dis **S**eralization **P**rotocol (RESP)](https://redis.io/topics/protocol).
>
> These types are designed to work in a request / response loop, representing
individual connections to Redis.
>
> The goal of this library is to provide individual building blocks for working
with Redis, while still providing enough mechanisms "out of the box" so users
can get started immediately with Redis.
