Xcode 8.2 beta was [released](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_8.2_beta/Release_Notes_for_Xcode_8.2_beta.pdf). **It is the final release to support Swift 2.3.** [Good Luck](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon/status/793215522196168704) migrating if you haven't yet! Other than this, Xcode 8.2 still bundles Swift 3.0.1 and the only other notable changes are SDK updates for the new MacBook Pro [Touch Bar](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/AbouttheTouchBar.html).

### News and community

Ole Begemann wrote an article, [*How to Read the Swift Standard Library Source*](https://oleb.net/blog/2016/10/swift-stdlib-source/), where he explains how to checkout and build Swift, and gives tips for digging into the source. This is a great way to get started with Swift, especially if you've been confused by `.gyb` files.

Brian Gesiak wrote a post on [swift-llvm and swift-clang](http://modocache.io/swift-llvm-and-swift-clang), explaining why Apple released custom forks of LLVM and clang, and what they contain that the upstream repositories do not.

Brian Gesiak got [Swift building on CentOS](https://twitter.com/modocache/status/792592110532853761).

[Scriptarian](https://scriptarian.com) is a new Mac app that allows users to automate macOS and any AppleScript-enabled app with Swift.

### Commits and pull requests

**@practicalswift** added a number of new [compiler crashers](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/3a9bef9d91982b59094fb32dc281ebdf19ed3a03), bringing to total number of unresolved crashers to 96. (5180 have been resolved.)

Thomas Catterall implemented `CustomReflectable` for `Notification` in corelibs-foundation.

**@airspeedswift** opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5521) to resolve 3 ABI FIXME's. This change collapses the two versions `Array.append(contentsOf:)`, one that takes a sequence and one that takes a collection. There's some interesting background in the description, too.

### Proposals in review

Proposal [SE-0145](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0145-package-manager-version-pinning.md): *Package Manager Version Pinning* from Daniel Dunbar, Ankit Aggarwal & Graydon Hoare is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20161031/028579.html).

> This is a proposal for adding package manager features to "pin" or "lock" package dependencies to particular versions.

### Mailing lists

David Goodine [started a thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20161024/028440.html) discussing the `guard` and unwrapping syntax, specifically how it can be verbose and redundant. Chris Lattner [suggested](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20161024/028448.html) a new keyword, `unwrap`, which would change `guard let foo = foo else { }` to `guard unwrap foo else { }`. Erica Sadun has drafted a proposal [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/erica/db9ce92b3d23cb20799460f603c0ae7c). There's been a lot of feedback so far, and Erica is continuing to revise the proposal.
