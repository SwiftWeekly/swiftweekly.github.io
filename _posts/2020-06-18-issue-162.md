    heading: Support the things you love
    body: Hello! My name is Paul and I run Hacking with Swift. I'm not going to use this spot to tell you to check out my books, but instead I'm sponsoring this issue because I appreciate the work that Bas and Kristaps do and I want to support them. Support the things you love, folks, otherwise they might just go away ‚ù§Ô∏è

WWDC is now very, very near. Only a little bit more than a weekend before things
kick off. Very exciting!

Also ‚Äî a note regarding this issue's sponsor. This was so unexpected ‚Äî but so,
so very kind. His point is spot on. Putting together Swift Weekly Brief time
and time again is something [I'm very happy to do](https://basthomas.github.io/curating-swift-weekly),
and it is a real pleasure to be able to support the Swift community this way.

But it isn't always glamorous, so don't [take things for granted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePuOrCbIW-o).

Thank you, Paul! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Enjoy WWDC everyone, and looking forward to a hopefully jam-packed issue in two
weeks!

### Proposals in review

[SSWG-0013](https://github.com/swift-server/sswg/blob/master/proposals/0013-swift-aws-lambda-runtime.md): *Swift AWS Lambda Runtime* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/sswg-0013-swift-aws-lambda-runtime/37466).

> Many modern systems have client components like iOS, macOS or watchOS
applications as well as server components that those clients interact with.
Serverless functions are often the easiest and most efficient way for client
application developers to extend their applications into the cloud.
>
> Serverless functions are increasingly becoming a popular choice for running
event-driven or otherwise ad-hoc compute tasks in the cloud. They power mission
critical microservices and data intensive workloads. In many cases, serverless
functions allow developers to more easily scale and control compute costs given
their on-demand nature.
>
> When using serverless functions, attention must be given to resource
utilization as it directly impacts the costs of the system. This is where Swift
shines! With its low memory footprint, deterministic performance, and quick
start time, Swift is a fantastic match for the serverless functions
architecture.
>
> Combine this with Swift's developer friendliness, expressiveness, and
emphasis on safety, and we have a solution that is great for developers at all
skill levels, scalable, and cost effective.

[SSWG-0014](https://github.com/swift-server/sswg/blob/master/proposals/0014-swift-backtrace.md): *Swift Backtrace* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/sswg-0014-swift-backtrace/37602).

> Printing backtraces when applications crash is a critical component in
diagnostics of real-world production issues on the Server.
>
> When applications crash on the Server, it is desired for the crash
information to be captured and printed along side the application logs so that
log aggregation tools (e.g. Splunk) could include the crash information and
used for alerting and further analysis offline.
>
> At this point of time, Swift does not print crash backtraces when compiled
in release mode on Linux. This means that Swift server applications can crash
silently making the operation of such applications difficult.

### Swift Forums

[Guy Brooker](https://forums.swift.org/u/guyb/summary) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/static-thread-safety/37542)
for static thread safety.

> One of the [principal goals of Swift](https://swift.org/about/) is "to make
writing and maintaining correct programs easier for the developer". Swift has
gone a long way to eliminate many common errors found in other programming
languages through static type checking, ensuring safe memory access. The free
for all in C where anything and everything was possible by casting pointers to
different data types is thankfully over.
>
> Most modern non-trivial Swift applications require some form of concurrency,
asynchronously retrieving information over a network, firing timers , updating
UI or handling notifications, however Swift does not provide concurrency
primitives today. Accessing variables concurrently in Swift is inherently
dangerous, and is a very easy mistake to make. The Swift language provides no
safety for a developer of concurrent code, leaving them in a similar position
as the C programmer of yesteryear, permitting frequent programming errors to
go un-flagged.
>
> This proposal sets out some small language changes which would allow the
compiler to spot basic concurrent programming errors. To be clear, the title
of this proposal "Static thread safety" is intended to mean compile time thread
safety checks. It does not add concurrency primitives, nor provide any
automatic concurrency or thread safety. It simply allows developers to write
safer code.

[Johannes Weiss](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss) shared [some thoughts](https://forums.swift.org/t/running-many-operations-concurrently-but-in-batches/37518)
on running many operations concurrently, but in batches.

> So here's some more example code for a question that I've been asked
repeatedly: How can I run a large number of operations whilst limiting this to
`N` running at the same time. You may want to do that if you have to do many
HTTP requests to a website but you don't want to overload the website and say
do only 10 at the same time.

[Quincey Morris](https://forums.swift.org/u/quinceymorris/summary) pitched [another proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/await-async-part-deux/37491/30)
for `async` / `await`.

> As far as I‚Äôm concerned, the goal here is to add Swift language features to
provide a path-of-execution serialization operator, along with a genuine notion
of an asynchronous function.
>
> Beyond that: there is a further discussion which we haven‚Äôt even started
having yet. There are other asynchronous patterns we might like to provide for.
How about, for example, an await operator that operates on "groups" of
asynchronous functions (aka concurrency or dispatch groups)? How about an
algebra of futures or promises that can be used within the implementations of
asynchronous functions to provide more sophisticated usage patterns?

[Dave Abrahams](https://twitter.com/DaveAbrahams) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-way-to-check-for-unique-storage-in-standard-library-collections/37595)
for a way to check for unique storage in standard library collections.

> Consider:

```swift
struct Vector<T> {
  var scalars: [T]
  static func +=(lhs: inout Vector, rhs: Vector) {
    for i in lhs.scalars.indices { lhs.scalars[i] += rhs.scalars[i] }
  }
}
```

> This implementation is suboptimal in the case where lhs.scalars shares its
storage with another array, because it first copies the scalars in lhs into new
storage and then writes over them, accumulating elements from rhs into it. What
we really want to be able to do is:

```swift
struct Vector<T> {
  var scalars: [T]
  static func +=(lhs: inout Vector, rhs: Vector) {
    if hasUniquelyReferencedStorage(&lhs.scalars) {
      for i in lhs.scalars.indices { lhs.scalars[i] += rhs.scalars[i] }
    }
    else { 
      lhs = lhs + rhs // build new storage once and replace old storage with it
    }
  }
}
```

> Currently the only known way to do the check for unique storage is a horrible
hack that probably violates the memory model.
>
> Ideally, we would have a way to ask generically whether all the references in
any given type were uniquely-referenced, but as a start, it would be extremely
useful just to be able to ask that question about arrays, sets, and
dictionaries. My pitch to you is that we expose
`unsafeHasUniquelyReferencedStorage` in the standard library.
