A busy two weeks: the long-awaiting Swift 5 was released, alongside Xcode 10.2.
It took a while, but it is awesome to see this great release come to life.

Furthermore, Swift 5.1 is already being worked on, and there are _tons_ of
proposals ongoing, so you can expect a lot more interesting things to come!

[SE-0246](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0246-mathable.md): *Generic Math(s) Functions* was [accepted with modifications](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0246-generic-math-functions/22244).

> Hi, everybody. The review for SE-0246: Generic Math Functions ran from March
> 11th through the 25th. This review was extended several times in order to

> they felt about this rapid iteration, and in particular on whether they felt

>
> Feedback was positive on the general idea of providing a standard way of
> accessing this functionality. Some suggestions were made that the authors
> agreed with and chose to immediately incorporate into the proposal, leading
> to extension of the review period. The main suggestions that weren't
> incorporated into mid-review revisions were as follows:
>
> - Several people expressed unhappiness that `log` meant the natural logarithm
> (base _e_). Unfortunately, as observed in the review, the most obvious
> alternative name for the natural logarithm is ln, which is not a good
> programming name: it's too short and too visually similar to keywords like
> `in`. `log` for the natural logarithm is also extensively precedented in
> many programming languages, including C, Swift's most obvious antecedent (and
> the way that people have gained access to this functionality in Swift before
> this proposal). Ultimately, the core team believes that sticking with `log` is
> the best choice even if there's some risk of people using it when they meant
> `log10` or `log2`.
>
> - There was a suggestion that create a `Math` module might create conflicts
> with names used by other libraries today. The core team agrees that this is
> an issue which needs further study and work, but decided to define it away
> for this proposal by simply merging the proposed Math module directly into
> the Swift module, which already has some similar math functions (such as `min`
> and `floor`); there didn't seem to be a strong motivation for separating out
> the functions proposed here.
>
> Therefore, SE-0246 is accepted with the modifications that the `Math` library
> should not be added and that the proposed new entities in it should instead
> be added directly to Swift.

[SE-0245](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0245-array-uninitialized-initializer.md): *Add an Array Initializer with Access to Uninitialized Storage* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0245-add-an-array-initializer-with-access-to-uninitialized-storage/21469/18).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0256](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0256-contiguous-collection.md): *Introduce `{Mutable}ContiguousCollection` protocol* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0256-introduce-mutable-contiguouscollection-protocol/22569).

> This proposal introduces two new protocols: `ContiguousCollection`, which
> refines `Collection`, and `MutableContiguousCollection`, which refines
> `MutableCollection`. Both provide guaranteed access to an underlying
> unsafe buffer.

[SE-0255](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0255-omit-return.md): *Implicit returns from single-expression functions* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0255-implicit-returns-from-single-expression-functions/22544).

> Swift provides a pleasant shorthand for short closures: if a closure contains
> just a single expression, that expression is implicitly returned--the `return`
> keyword can be omitted.  We should provide this shorthand for functions as
> well.

[SE-0254](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0254-static-subscripts.md): *Static and class subscripts* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0254-static-and-class-subscripts/22537).

> We propose allowing `static subscript` and, in classes, `class subscript`
> declarations. These could be used through either `TypeName[index]` or
> `TypeName.self[index]` and would have all of the capabilities you would
> expect of a subscript. We also propose extending dynamic member lookup to
> static properties by using static subscripts.

[SE-0253](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0253-callable.md): *Introduce callables* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0253-static-callables/22243).

> This proposal introduces [callables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callable_object)
> to Swift. Callables are values that define function-like behavior and can be
> applied using function application syntax.
>
> In a nutshell, we propose to introduce a new declaration syntax with the
> keyword `call`:

{% highlight swift %}
struct Adder {
    var base: Int
    call(_ x: Int) -> Int {
        return base + x
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Values that have a `call` member can be applied like functions, forwarding
> arguments to the `call` member.

{% highlight swift %}
let add3 = Adder(base: 3)
add3(10) // => 13
{% endhighlight %}

[SE-0252](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0252-keypath-dynamic-member-lookup.md): *Key Path Member Lookup* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0252-key-path-member-lookup/22172).

> This proposal attempts to enable stronger-typed version of the dynamic member
> lookup by extending functionality of an existing `@dynamicMemberLookup`
> attribute with key path based variants.
>
> Dynamic member lookup allows a type to opt in to extending member lookup
> ("dot" syntax) for arbitrary member names, turning them into a string that
> can then be resolved at runtime. Dynamic member lookup allows
> interoperability with dynamic languages where the members of a particular
> instance can only be determined at runtime... but no earlier. Dynamic member
> lookups, therefore, tend to work with type-erased wrappers around foreign
> language objects (e.g., `PyVal` for an arbitrary Python object), which don't
> provide much static type information.

[SE-0251](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0251-simd-additions.md): *SIMD additions* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0251-simd-additions/21957).

> A few teams within Apple have requested additions to the new SIMD types and
> protocols to better support their use cases. In addition, there are some

### Swift Forums

[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter/) shares why the closure syntax uses [the `in` keyword](https://forums.swift.org/t/history-why-does-closure-syntax-use-the-keyword-in/21885/2).

> It's my fault, sorry. In the early days of Swift, we had a closure syntax
> that was very similar to traditional Javascript,
> `func (arg: Type, arg: Type) -> Return { ... }`. While this is nice and
> regular syntax, it is of course also very bulky and awkward if you're trying
> to support expressive functional APIs, such as `map`/`filter` on collections,
> or if you want libraries to be able to provide closure-based APIs that feel
> like extensions of the language.
>
> Our earliest adopters at Apple complained about this, and mandated that we
> support Ruby-style trailing closure syntax.
> This is tricky to fit into a C-style syntax like Swift's, and we tried many
> different iterations, including literally Ruby's `{|args| }` syntax, but many
> of them suffered from ambiguities or simply distaste and revolt from our
> early adopters. We wanted something that still looked like other parts of the
> language, but which could be parsed unambiguously and could span the breadth
> of use cases from a fully explicit function signature to extremely compact.
>
> We had already taken `in` as a keyword, we couldn't use `->` like Java does
> because it's already used to denote the return type, and we were concerned
> that using `=>` like C# would be too visually confusing. `in` made
> `xs.map { x in f(x) }` look vaguely like `for x in xs { f(x) }`, and people
> hated it less than the alternatives.

[Nate Chandler](https://twitter.com/neightchan) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-implicit-returns-from-single-expression-functions/21898) for implicit
returns from Single-Expression Functions.

[David Smith](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-add-a-string-initializer-with-access-to-uninitialized-storage/22611)
to add a `String` initializer with access to uninitialized storage.

> I've been working on improving the performance of `NSString`-to-`String`
> bridging, and Michael Ilseman pointed out that the more we can build it out
> of public API rather than adding a bunch of private stuff for Foundation's
> use, the better off everyone is.
>
> This new initializer is designed to be consistent with the [recently-accepted similar initializer on `Array`](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0245-array-uninitialized-initializer.md).

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79)
pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-property-delegates/21895)
to add Property Delegates.

> There are property implementation patterns that come up repeatedly. Rather

> Some of the examples are the same, but this proposal is a completely

[Michael Ilseman](https://twitter.com/ilseman) gave [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/string-consumption/21907)
on "`String` Consumption".

> **Collection consumers**
>
> Processing a string, or any `Collection` really, typically involves tracking
> and advancing a position (i.e. an `Index`). This makes something akin to
> `Slice` a great basis to add consuming operations, which advance indices from
> the front (or back if bidirectional).
>
> There are at least 3 ways to surface this:

> 1. A new wrapper type
> 2. Add these to `Slice`
> 3. Add these to all `Collection`s that are their own `SubSequence`

> Here's [an example](https://gist.github.com/milseman/f9b5528345db3a36bbdd138af52c5cda)
> of approach 3, which would put this functionality in a lot of namespaces
> (`Slice`, `Substring`, even `Data`). Having these broadly available could
> help discoverability, but we also don’t want to pollute namespaces. These are
> all "mutating" because they advance indices, but not because they modify the
> underlying collection. We need to see some usage to evaluate the tradeoffs.

> **Regex**

> I wrote more about regexes [here](https://gist.github.com/milseman/bb39ef7f170641ae52c13600a512782f#one-possible-approach)
