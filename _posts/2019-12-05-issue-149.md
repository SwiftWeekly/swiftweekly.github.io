Earlier today, I finished my last working day of the year. All the holiday
feelings are there now! I hope that you've had a great last weeks, including a
great Thanksgiving for those who celebrated it!

And a big special thanks to [Kristaps](https://twitter.com/fassko) for helping
out with this issue; I would not have been able to write it without him. üèé

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0269](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0269-implicit-self-explicit-capture.md): *Increase availability of implicit `self` in `@escaping` closures when reference cycles are unlikely to occur* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0269-increase-availability-of-implicit-self-in-escaping-closures-when-reference-cycles-are-unlikely-to-occur/30376/70).

> This proposal has been accepted. The proposal discussion roughly divided into
two parts:
>
> 1. Discussion around hoisting the explicit mention of `self` into the closure
capture list as the alternative to repeatedly writing explicit `self` in a
closure body (and having the compiler fix-it encourage that style)
> 2. The expansion of implicit `self` around the specific case where the type of
`self` is a value type
>
> The discussion on both topics was deeply constructive and productive. The
core team wants to express their deep thanks to everyone who contributed to
this discussion. Some really fantastic insights were made from different
perspectives.
>
> In the end, the core team felt that the hoisting `self` in the closure
capture list provided a better experience where explicit `self` will still be
encouraged as it (a) more clearly captures the intent of explicitly mentioning
`self` and (b) syntactically will be cleaner in the cases where `self` is
uttered multiple times.
>
> The discussion around the expansion of implicit `self` was a bit more
fragmented on the review, but ultimately the core team sided with expanding the
use of implicit `self` as proposed.

[SE-0271](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0271-package-manager-resources.md): *Package Manager Resources* was [accepted with modifications](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0271-package-manager-resources/31021).

> The feedback was positive, but two larger issues were brought up:
>
> - the proposal states that resource bundles will be located next to the built
executable only on Linux, but that doesn't quite match up with how software is
packaged up there. In addition, resources will also automatically be found in
all locations specified [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/blob/master/Docs/FHS%20Bundles.md)
and there will be a commandline flag to add search paths to custom locations.
> - the proposal will limit the usefulness of SwiftPM commandline tools on
macOS. We will make it possible to use Xcode specific resources in SwiftPM
directly.
>
> The SwiftPM code owners decided to accept a revised version of the proposal
which addresses both of these issues.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0264](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0264-stdlib-preview-package.md): *Standard Library Preview Package* is [under review #2](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0264-review-2-standard-library-preview-package/31288).

> We propose changing the Swift Evolution process to publish accepted proposals
as individual SwiftPM packages, as well as a `SwiftPreview` package that bundles
these proposal packages together. This group of packages will form the initial
landing spot for certain additions to the Swift standard library.
>
> Adding these packages serves the goal of allowing for rapid adoption of new
standard library features, enabling sooner real-world feedback, and allowing
for an initial period of time where that feedback can lead to source- and
ABI-breaking changes if needed.

### Swift Forums

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd) shared [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/reducing-friction-for-development-prebuilt-vscode-images/31109)
on reducing friction to get started with Swift through prebuilt Docker images
with complete toolchains, multiple SDKs, and pre-configured VSCode!

> An often cited problem for using Swift on other platforms is the effort
required to get everything working together. To help address this barrier to
entry, I have been exploring some options to reduce the initial friction for
development on other targets (e.g. android, Linux, etc).
>
> Now, I realize that some of my choices may be controversial for some, so, I
would like to preface this as I am **NOT** advocating that this be the only
development, merely an option for those that would like to use it. I personally
prefer to develop locally and use my editor of choice, so I can completely
understand why some may be frustrated with some of the tradeoffs made here.
Please note that I am not trying to remove those options, merely provide an
alternative which others can explore if it suits them.

[Filip Sakel](https://forums.swift.org/u/filip-sakel/summary) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/better-access-control-on-protocol-requirements/31237)
for Better Access Control on Protocol Requirements.

> The main problem is that you have to write a lot of boilerplate code. For
every new requirement that you want to be inaccessible to the user for your own
internal Types, you have to:
>
> 1. Write the initial Protocol requirement (like the `publish` method in
`Publisher`).
> 2. Rewrite that requirement in the internal Protocol (like the `_publish`
method in `TrustedPublisher`).
> 3. Cancel the initial requirement with an extension implementation that throws
a fatal error (like the `publish` method in the extension of
`TrustedPublisher`).
>
> What I propose is enabling the marking of Protocol requirements with Access
Levels.

[Becca Royal-Gordon](https://twitter.com/beccadax) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/concise-magic-file-names/31297)
to introduce a concise version of `#file`.

> Today, `#file` evaluates to a string literal containing the full path to the
current source file. We propose to instead have it evaluate to a human-readable
string containing the filename and module name, while preserving the existing
behavior in a new `#filePath` expression.

[David Hart](https://twitter.com/dhartbit) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-manager-conditional-target-dependencies/31306)
to add Package Manager Conditional Target Dependencies.

> This proposal introduces the ability for Swift package authors to
conditionalize target dependencies on platform and configuration with a similar
syntax to the one introduced in 
[SE-0238](0238-package-manager-build-settings.md) for build settings. This gives
developers more flexibility to describe complex target dependencies to support
multiple platforms or different configuration environments.

[Sergej Jaskiewicz](https://twitter.com/broadway_lamb) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/function-calls-in-key-paths/31307)
to add support for function calls in key paths.

> Today a key path may only reference properties and subscripts:

```swift
\Array<String>.[0].count
```

> But cannot reference method calls:

```swift
\Array<String>.[0].lowercased().count
//                 ^
//                 error: Invalid component of Swift key path
```

> Since Swift already supports subscripts, how hard can it be to implement
support for method calls in key paths? Sure, subscripts are different from
regular methods, but are they different enough to be an implementation problem?

### Finally

Swift 6 will include [breaking changes](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/1197581728665092096)!!!
