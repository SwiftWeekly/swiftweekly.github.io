It was a busy week on the main [apple/swift](https://github.com/apple/swift) repo. Here are some stats from GitHub Insights:

> Excluding merges, 39 authors have pushed 156 commits to master and 284 commits to all branches. On master, 401 files have changed and there have been 12,589 additions and 9,215 deletions..

It's great to see so much work being done so soon after WWDC. The core team and other contributors are making significant progress on the road to the official Swift 4 launch.

iOS 11 beta 2, tvOS 11 beta 2, and Swift Playgrounds 2 beta 2 were all released. Download them [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/), and keep filing radars!

### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 17: Testing in Swift](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/70319), Jesse and JP discuss how Swift and its set of open source tools are tested to ensure that every release breaks as little as possible. 😜

### News and community

Greg Heo [wrote a post](https://swiftunboxed.com/stdlib/json-encoder-encodable/) that looks at how Swift `Encoder` and `Encodable` work. There's been a lot of open source activity related to this new feature, so understanding how it works will help when trying to digest related PRs.

Matt Godbolt's Compiler Explorer now [supports Swift](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/877991651548975104).

David Owens [released a preview](https://owensd.io/2017/06/02/apous-early-preview/) for an extension to Visual Studio Code that supports Swift.

The Swift backend for the Swift-Evolution app, [Evo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evolution-app/id1210898168?mt=8), is [now open source](https://twitter.com/swift_evolution/status/878322333471068160).

Steven Hepting [explains](https://twitter.com/stevenhepting/status/878339681485635585) how Swift's `sort()` method is optimized. Find the [source code here](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/02e2bd5380af69948d2324b936bfc61e1454d8ea/stdlib/public/core/Sort.swift.gyb#L232-L301).

[Learn Swift Queens](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-Swift-Queens-Meetup/) & [Learn Swift Portland](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-Swift-Portland/), just launched. That's 11 [Learn Swift {CITY}](https://wordpress.com/post/swiftcoders.org/178) meet ups worldwide! Which city will be next?

[Brisk, a macOS app for submitting radars](https://github.com/br1sk/brisk) released [version 1.0](https://github.com/br1sk/brisk/releases/tag/1.0.0) and a quick [1.0.1 follow-up release](https://github.com/br1sk/brisk/releases/tag/1.0.1). Check out the release notes and keeping filing radars!

More [fallout](https://twitter.com/s1ddok/status/879406585939984386) from Tuplegate. This was interesting to me because [I use this exact same pattern](https://github.com/garricn/GGNObservable/blob/master/GGNObservable/Classes/Observable.swift#L53). As [Slava points out](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/879446070190800896) in the thread, there's still [room for improvement](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/012299.html).

### Commits and pull requests

This allows classes to share an Encoder/Decoder with its super class. For further explanation, check out this [thread](https://twitter.com/garricn/status/878426105585127425).

Philippe Hausler [merged a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10584) that fixes [SR-5292](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5292). This fixes a crasher in Foundation when working with slices of slices.

Joe Groff [merged a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10556) that adds support for optional chaining / force unwrapping when dealing with KeyPaths.

Doug Gregor [merged a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10565) that improves the handling of concrete types, type aliases, and recursion, and which fixes [SR-4295](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4295), [SR-4757](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4757), [SR-4786](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4786), [SR-5014](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5014), and [SR-4737](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4737).

Dave Abrahams [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9806) that implements [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md), the String index Overhaul (See below).

The manual displayed when running `man swift` on the command line [has been updated](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10241).

Maxim Moiseev [merged a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9466) that fixes backward compatibility for `flatMap` on `[String]`. Check out this related [Swift Puzzle by Robert Widmann](https://twitter.com/codafi_/status/878330155642396673).

David Farler [merged a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-clang/pull/95) that upstreams Apple's (previously) internal index-while-building changes released with Xcode 9.

If you ever wonder what the details are for a `rdar://` that a particular PR fixes, [feel free to ask](https://twitter.com/garricn/status/879551154316689408).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md): *String Index Overhaul* is back [in review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170619/037653.html) after some revisions.

### Mailing lists

Erica Sadun [made a pitch](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170626/037730.html) for a `!!` operator, which she calls "Unwrap or Die". You can find a draft in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/erica/423e4b1c63b95c4c90338cdff4939a9b).

> Using an operator to provide feedback on the context of a failed unwrap has become a commonly implemented approach in the Swift developer Community. What are your thoughts about adopting this widely-used operator into the standard library?

Ben Cohen [made a pitch](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170626/037776.html) regarding `Substring` performance affordances.

> As outlined in [SE-0163](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0163-string-revision-1.md), the more general question of implicit conversion from `Substring` to `String` was deferred pending feedback on the initial implementation. To date, the feedback we’ve received hasn’t suggested that such an implicit conversion is necessary &mdash; that migrations from 3.2 to 4.0 haven’t led to an extensive need to perform `Substring` -> `String` conversion. Any further input, either on or off list, about this particular aspect of migration would be very gratefully received.

Itai Ferber sent [a message on Swift-Evolution](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170619/037672.html) asking for feedback regarding [SE-0166](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0166-swift-archival-serialization.md) and [SE-0167](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0167-swift-encoders.md) and letting the community know that suggestions have already been implemented and will continue to be considered.

Robert Bennett made an [interesting pitch](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170619/037676.html) for declaring `let` in protocols. I didn't realize this problem existed.

> I’m bumping into an annoying problem with protocols. In a `class` or `struct` it is common to have a `let` instance variable and assign it in `init`. Unfortunately there is no way to translate this into a protocol with `init` in an extension.

### Finally

Taking can [sometimes](https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/878499165663240192) feel as good as giving.
