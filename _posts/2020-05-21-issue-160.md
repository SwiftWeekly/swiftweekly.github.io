And so, another two weeks have passed. For me, time seems to pass so quickly and
yet at the same time, slowly.

We're now about a month away from WWDC20 "taking off" — what that means exactly
is still a surprise, but I'm very much looking forward to it.

Also, today's issue coincides with Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD).
It's a topic very dear to me. There are some [tasks on this website's
repository](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly/swiftweekly.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aaccessibility)
that aim to make the site more accessible. Any help on those would mean the
world to me.

After all, I took over the curation of this newsletter from Jesse because I
wanted to keep sharing what's happening in Swift open source with all those
others benefiting from it.

There are also still [sponsorship opportunities](https://swiftweekly.github.io/sponsorship/)
for the newsletter, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could share that
with those who might be interested in helping with the newsletter in that way.
It allows us to keep delivering it to your inbox every other Thursday!

Anyway... there's also news!

### News and community

Swift 5.3 [is going to be released soon](https://forums.swift.org/t/whats-new-in-swift-5-3/36508),
and Larry provided a great overview of what's included.

[Tim Condon](https://twitter.com/0xTim) wrote [an article](https://www.timc.dev/posts/future-of-server-side-swift) 
discussing the future of server-side Swift.

[Vinicius Vendramini](https://twitter.com/vvendra) announced [Gryphon](https://vinivendra.github.io/Gryphon/),
a Swift to Kotlin translator — a project he's been working on for the past three
(!) years.

### Commits and pull requests

[Mike Ash](https://twitter.com/mikeash) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/31468)
that adds a utility that can attach to a running Swift process and inspect/debug
the runtime's behavior.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/2736)
allowing the Swift Package Manager to optionally use the new swift-driver,
making it much easier to try it out for your own projects.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0283](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0283-tuples-are-equatable-comparable-hashable.md): *Tuples Conform to `Equatable`, `Comparable`, and `Hashable`* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0283-tuples-conform-to-equatable-comparable-and-hashable/36658).

> Almost all the feedback we received was positive, and the Core Team is
convinced that this is a great incremental step forward. Some excellent points
on possible concern over future tech debt in the compiler and runtime were
brought up, but the Core Team believes that it is manageable and that this
proposal helps push Swift forward in a positive direction.

### Swift Forums

[Dan Loman](https://forums.swift.org/u/namolnad/summary) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-firstas-to-sequence/36665)
to add `firstAs()` to `Sequence`.

> I often find it necessary (and I imagine this is somewhat common) to find and
cast the first matching element of a sequence. There are of course a few
techniques that could be used to do this. For example:

```swift
sequence.filter { $0 is MyType }.first as? MyType
sequence.compactMap { $0 as? MyType }.first
sequence.first { $0 is MyLongTypeName } as? MyLongTypeName
if let element = sequence.first(where: { $0 is MyLongTypeName }) as? MyLongTypeName {
    // do something
}
```

> The last option should leave us with the fewest iterations and is the option
I've chosen to implement as a simple helper in a number of my projects.
>
> This can allow for very compact, straightforward, and efficient calls to find
the first element you're looking for:

```swift
// explicit type
if let element = sequence.firstAs(MyType.self) {
    // do something
}
// inferred type
if let element: MyLongTypeName = sequence.firstAs() {
    // do something
}
// inferred type
let label: UILabel?

switch searchArea {
case .subviews:
    label = subviews.firstAs()
case .arrangedSubviews:
    label = stackView.arrangedSubviews.firstAs()
}
```

[Kumar C](https://forums.swift.org/u/kumarc/summary) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/use-instead-of-curly-braces-for-single-expression-bodied-property-getters-subscripted-getters-and-functions/36676)
to use `->` instead of curly braces for single expression bodied property
getters, subscripted getters and functions.

> As of [SE-0255](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0255-omit-return.md)
developers can omit the return keyword for single-expression bodied getters for
properties, subscripts and single expression bodies functions. This is a nice
improvement to the language. Here's an even more improved version of the same
proposal.
>
> **Existing Syntax for Properties**

```swift
var location: Location { .init(latitude: lat, longitude: long) }
```

> **Proposed Change**

```swift
var location: Location -> .init(latitude: lat, longitude: long)
```

[Brent Royal-Gordon](https://twitter.com/brentdax) pitched [a follow-up proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-2-cross-import-overlays/36710)
to cross-importing overlays.

>> Cross-import overlays allow Swift to automatically import additional
"overlay" modules based on the combination of imports in a particular source
file. They allow one library or framework to seamlessly offer tailored APIs for
interoperating with another, without imposing additional dependencies or code
on clients who don’t need it.
>
> This feature has now been implemented and is in master and 5.3 nightly
compilers, hidden behind the `-Xfrontend -enable-cross-import-overlays` flag.
The proposal has been rewritten and reflects the implementation in the
nightlies.

[Tim Condon](https://twitter.com/0xTim) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-enable-test-discovery-by-default/36619)
to enable test discovery on Linux by default.

> Swift 5.1 [introduced](https://forums.swift.org/t/test-discovery-on-linux/26203)
Test Discovery on Linux adding an `--enable-test-discovery` flag you could pass
to `swift test` so it would automatically pick up tests on Linux to run, without
having to manually specifying them, which is prone to problems.
>
> Since this has been in use for several months now without major issues, I
propose we enable the flag by default. This simplifies testing on Linux, stops
[build errors](https://forums.swift.org/t/make-test-discovery-on-by-default/30321)
when building on Linux without a `LinuxMain.swift` present and no flag, and
generally makes life a bit easier, especially for newcomers.

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/rfc-policies-for-swift-platform-development/36257)
to add policies for Swift platform development.

> In order to create a stable ecosystem for Swift, it is important that we
maintain a single coherent ecosystem across platforms. Whenever technical
feasible, the project should aim to provide the same interfaces, behaviours,
and capabilities on every platform. For example, the compiler and build system
should support both static and dynamic linking of libraries on all platforms.

[Owen Voorhees](https://twitter.com/owenvoorhees) brought up [required changes](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0279-and-variadic-parameters/36410)
to his proposal on multiple variadic parameters in functions.

> I'm currently looking into whether my proposal for [multiple variadic
parameters in functions](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/1125)
will need any updates now that [SE-0279](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0279-multiple-trailing-closures.md)
is accepted. While experimenting with the implementation on `master`, I noticed
the following is not allowed:

```swift
func foo(bar: () -> (), baz: () -> ()..., qux: () -> ()) {}
foo {} baz: {} _: {} _: {} qux: {} // error: extra arguments at positions #4, #3, #3, #4 in call
```

> I assume this is mostly a consequence of the backwards scan argument matching
rule, but is it the intended behavior (the error message indicates it may just
be a bug)? The proposal text doesn't mention varargs. I think choosing to allow
it or disallow it would both be reasonable, but it would be nice to specify the
intended behavior a little more clearly.
