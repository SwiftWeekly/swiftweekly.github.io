### News and community

Swift 5.1.1 was [released](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-5-1-1-released-linux-only/29732).

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://github.com/xedin/) wrote [a blog post](https://swift.org/blog/new-diagnostic-arch-overview/)
about the architectural improvements they've been making to get better type
error messages, and goes into detail as to how this works under the hood.

[Sahin Yort](https://github.com/thesayyn) added [initial support for SwiftPM](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift/pull/329)
to Bazel!

With the release of [`async-http-client` 1.0.0](https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client/releases/tag/1.0.0),
there now is a stable release!

Along `async-http-client`, SwiftNIO shipped [version 2.9.0](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/releases/tag/2.9.0).

[Alex Lorenz](https://github.com/hyp) announced [`llvm-project`](https://forums.swift.org/t/the-github-swift-specific-split-llvm-project-repositories-are-now-read-only/29911),
a monorepository for all LLVM-related Swift projects.

### Commits and pull requests

[David Smith](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/27670)
improving the performance for decoding data into ASCII... by a factor of 500! 🤯

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0263](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0263-string-uninitialized-initializer.md): *Add a String Initializer with Access to Uninitialized Storage* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0263-add-a-string-initializer-with-access-to-uninitialized-storage/30057).

> The proposal has been accepted.

Well, that's as clear as it gets. :)

[SE-0266](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0266-synthesized-comparable-for-enumerations.md): *Synthesized `Comparable` conformance for `enum` types* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0266-synthesized-comparable-conformance-for-enum-types/29854).

> The proposal was received positively, and removes boilerplate code for many
common cases.
>
> Concern was raised by some reviewers regarding the implicit reliance on source
ordering to synthesize the conformance. The core team feels this behavior is
justified based on several factors:
>
> - other features currently expose source ordering for enums (`CaseIterable`
order and `rawValue` assignment).
> - `<` implementations on enums can easily be written in a way where adding
new cases may not break compilation; comparable conformance must always be
considered when adding cases even today.
> - conforming a type to a protocol requires an understanding of what that
conformance means and how it is being fulfilled. "It compiles" is never enough.
>
> Much of the review was occupied with discussion of adding support for structs
and raw-representable enums. The core team would welcome further pitches
weighing the pros and cons of these additions.

### Returned proposals

[SE-0264](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0264-stdlib-preview-package.md): *Standard Library Preview Package* was [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0264-standard-library-preview-package/29865).

> The review for SE-0264 has concluded. We had a uniformly positive response to
the idea of previewing standard library content, but many people had questions
and concerns about how the process and versioning was supposed to work. Then
John McCall [advanced](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0264-standard-library-preview-package/29068/21)
the idea of having separately-versioned packages for each proposal. Several
people were favorably disposed, and we didn't hear any objections from anyone
including the proposers. The core team is, by and large, persuaded that this
approach has many advantages and would like to see a revised proposal that
includes it.
>
> Thanks to all for your engagement, and for making this process work. Even when
a review goes back for revision, we are still making progress, together, on the
evolution of Swift.

The last sentence also being a good reminder that any input into the evolution
process is greatly appreciated.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0267](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0267-where-on-contextually-generic.md): *`where` clauses on contextually generic declarations* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0267-where-clauses-on-contextually-generic-declarations/30051).

> This proposal aims to lift the mostly artificial restriction on attaching
`where` clauses to declarations that reference only outer generic parameters.
Simply put, this means you no longer have to worry about the `'where' clause
cannot be attached` error inside most generic contexts.

[SE-0268](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0268-didset-semantics.md): *Refine `didSet` Semantics* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0268-refine-didset-semantics/30049).

> Introduce two changes to `didSet` semantics - 
>
> 1. If a `didSet` observer does not reference the `oldValue` in its body, then
the call to fetch the `oldValue` will be skipped. We refer to this as a "simple"
`didSet`.
> 2. If we have a "simple" `didSet` and no `willSet`, then we could allow
modifications to happen in-place.
>
> Currently, Swift always calls the property's getter to get the `oldValue` if
we have a `didSet` observer, even if the observer does not refer to the
`oldValue` in its body.
>
> This might look harmless, but it is doing redundant work (by allocating
storage and loading a value which isn't used). It could also be expensive if the
getter performs some non-trivial task and/or returns a large value.
>
> For example:

```swift
struct Container {
  var items: [Int] = .init(repeating: 1, count: 100) {
    didSet {
      // Do some stuff, but don't access oldValue
    }
  }
  
  mutating func update() {
    for index in 0..<items.count {
      items[index] = index + 1
    }
  }
}

var container = Container()
container.update()
```

> This will create 100 copies of the array to provide the `oldValue`, even
though they're not used at all.

### Swift Forums

[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) shared [some thoughts](https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-representation-of-polymorphic-interfaces-in-sil-with-substituted-function-types/29711)
on improving the representation of polymorphic interfaces in SIL with
"substituted function types".

> Swift Intermediate Language (SIL) has a lot of incidental complexity arising
from representational issues in how we handle the types of
polymorphically-callable functions such as protocol witnesses, class methods,
and closures. Here is a proposed design for substituted function types, which
tries to address some of these issues.
>
> To implement a polymorphic interface, such as a protocol method or class
method, the different implementations have to share a common generic
machine-level calling convention, even though each implementation has a
different concrete function type derived from the specific parent type it
provides an implementation for.

[Nate Cook](https://twitter.com/nnnnnnnn) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-add-rangeset-and-related-collection-operations/29961)
to add `RangeSet` and related `Collection` operations.

> We can use a range to address a single range of consecutive elements in a
collection, but the standard library doesn't currently provide a way to access
discontiguous elements. This proposes the addition of a `RangeSet` type that
can store the location of any number of collections indices, along with
collection operations that let us use a range set to access or modify the
collection. In addition, because these operations depend on mutable collection
algorithms that we've long wanted in the standard library, this proposal
includes those too.

[Ted Krememenk](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) shared [some thoughts](https://forums.swift.org/t/trajectory-for-evaluating-adding-automatic-differentiation-to-swift/30048) on
evaluating adding Automatic Differentiation to Swift.

> One of the efforts of the Swift for TensorFlow project has been to explore
adding features like [Automatic Differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation)
to the Swift language. This is a powerful capability that can significantly
enrich Swift’s potential as a programming language for scientific computing,
numerics, and machine learning.
>
> Speaking on behalf of the Swift Core Team, we are interested in evaluating
incorporating this capability directly into the Swift language.
>
> [..]
>
> To summarize:
>
> - An implementation of Automatic differentiation will be added to the
compiler, guarded under a flag (or flags) to indicate it is an experimental
feature. This will be done directly on `master`.
>
> Once implementations are ready, each component of the feature will go through
the Swift Evolution process. Until that time, the experimental feature will not
be included in official Swift releases.

[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/backwards-deployable-conformances/29876)
allowing backwards-deployable conformances.

> Let's say it's suddenly vitally important that Int conforms to Collection.

```swift
extension Int: Collection {
  public var startIndex: Int { 0 }
  public var endIndex: Int { self.bitWidth }
  public subscript(index: Int) -> Int { (self >> index) & 1 }
}
```

> What's the problem? Well, to start, none of these accessors exist in iOS 13,
which means that if someone tries to use this new conformance in iOS, their app
will just crash when running on iOS 13. [That's a limitation of shipping Swift
as part of the OS.](https://swift.org/blog/abi-stability-and-apple/)
>
> There are two ways to resolve this today: `@available` with a set of minimum
OS versions, or `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient`. But that still doesn't stop someone
from writing this code...

```swift
let someInt = 42
myArray.append(contentsOf: someInt)
```

> ...and trying to run that on iOS 13, where the conformance doesn't exist. If
the `append(contentsOf:)` is not optimized away, this will cause problems.
>
> In theory, we have the same two options for how to deal with this: restrict
the use of the conformance with availability, or emit the conformance into
client binaries. I'll discuss each of those in turn and then a secret third
option that I think is the best choice.

[Lantua](https://forums.swift.org/u/lantua/summary) asked [for clarification](https://forums.swift.org/t/source-compatibility/29814)
on source compatability, and [Brent Royal-Gordon](https://twitter.com/brentdax)
gave a great answer:

> There are two kinds of Swift releases:
>
> - "Non-breaking release": Language changes that would break any existing Swift
code are not permitted. Any code that was valid before should continue to build
and function the same way.
>
> - "Source-breaking release": Some language changes may affect existing, valid
code, either making it invalid or changing its behavior. A source-breaking
release will add a new version to the compiler's -swift-version flag;
specifying the previous version will cause it to emulate the old compiler's
behavior in situations where it's changed, and usually emit deprecation warnings
telling the user what to update for the new version.*
>
> However, things are not quite as black-and-white as this. A
non-source-breaking release may sometimes include very small changes—bug fixes,
new overloads—that could theoretically break existing code, as long as we
believe the breakage will be very small or nonexistent in practice and the
benefit is worth the risk. This is very much a judgement call and the core team
is typically involved with these decisions.

[Frederick Kellison-Linn]() pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/instance-level-polymorphism/30087)
to add suppport for instance-level polymorphism.

> I've seen some similar ideas discussed on the forums (notably [Polymorphic
methods in enums](https://forums.swift.org/t/polymorphic-methods-in-enums/15093))
which are focused around the idea of improving the experience of attaching
case-specific behavior to enums without having a totally fragmented
implementation. I encountered this issue yet again yesterday and wanted to
solicit feedback on some thoughts I had about potential solutions.

### Finally

Together, you can make everything [less horrible](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/1186424549455224832).
Teamwork is great!
