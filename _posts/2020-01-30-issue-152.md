I think I don't have to mention much more than that a lot of fantastic
information on the distant future of Swift has been shared in the last two
weeks: the road to Swift 6, progress on the Function Builders proposal, and
more. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

This is a big issue with lots of interesting topics being discussed!

### Starter tasks

- [SR-12085](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-12085) [Compiler] Clean up
`TypeCheckType` so it never returns `Type()`
- [TF-1107](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-1107) [Autodiff] Add JVPs to
standard library

### News and community

[Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) shared [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/on-the-road-to-swift-6/32862)
on the road to Swift 6, with many interesting insights. If there's one thing
you're going to pick up from this issue, it should be this â€” it's a great read.
Some things mentioned:

- Faster builds
- More informative and accurate diagnostics
- Reliable and fluid debugging experience
- Provide excellent solutions for major language features such as memory
ownership and concurrency
- Significantly improve the performance of incremental builds
- Improve code completion performance, reliability, and experience

Like I said; you're going to want to give this a read.

[JP Simard](https://twitter.com/simjp) created a poll [about the oldest Swift version people are actively using](https://twitter.com/simjp/status/1218613429881040897);
a quite surprisingly high amount (to me) is pretty up-to-date with the latest
Swift versions!

[Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) announced [`swift-doc`](https://twitter.com/mattt/status/1221863163915694085),
an (experimental) command-line utility for generating documentation for Swift
projects. One of the distinguishing features of `swift-doc` is that it operates
on Swift code at a syntactic level, without first compiling it.

[George Barnett](https://twitter.com/glbrntt) released [SwiftNIO 2.13.0](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/releases/tag/2.13.0).

### Commits and pull requests

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://twitter.com/pyaskevich) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28837)
that is a big step toward improving type inference for closures over time.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged a bunch of pull requests:

- [#29331](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29331) is a large refactor he's
been doing on-and-off for a while. By itself it has no user-visible effect,
but it's the building block to make function builders more powerful and
expressive.
- [#29409](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29409) makes supporting multiple
conditions for `if` statements within function builder closures a
straightforward generalization of the refactored code. This would have required
some gross hackery with the old implementation of function builders.
- [#29419](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29419) adds support for
`if #available` within function builders.

All this is part of a much larger effort to improve function builders, and
[this post](https://forums.swift.org/t/function-builders-implementation-progress/32981)
explains this effort further.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0276](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0276-multi-pattern-catch-clauses.md): *Multi-Pattern Catch Clauses* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0276-multi-pattern-catch-clauses/33220).

> Feedback was almost universally positive, and the proposal has been accepted!
Thank you to everyone who participated in the review process.

### Rejected proposals

[SE-0275](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0275-allow-more-characters-like-whitespaces-and-punctuations-for-escaped-identifiers.md): *Allow more characters (like whitespaces and punctuations) for escaped identifiers* was [rejected](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0275-allow-more-characters-like-whitespaces-and-punctuations-for-escaped-identifiers/32538/46).

> The core team has decided to reject this proposal. Community reaction was
mixed, and many of the people both supporting and rejecting the idea had
concerns about the breadth of the set of characters this allows. Allowing more
characters in identifiers would also add complexity to tooling, including
syntax highlighting, IDEs, and runtime reflection libraries, which would need
to be able to recognize quoted identifiers, know when identifiers would need
to be quoted for presentation purposes, and potentially need to implement more
elaborate parsing and escaping rules to handle these generalized identifiers.
In the core team's judgment, this added demand on tooling is not justified by
the amount of utility provided by the proposal.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0274](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0274-magic-file.md): *Concise magic file names* is [under a second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/re-review-se-0274-concise-magic-file-names/33171).

> The original review thread concluded with the core team accepting the
proposal in principal: `#file` will be updated to include only the file and
module names, with `#filePath` introduced for use cases that require the full
path to the file.
>
> However, during the review it was proposed that the exact format of `#file`
be specified, in order to allow for future tooling to rely on that format to
determine the file and module name from the string.
>
> The proposal has been amended to explicitly include this format, and this
re-review is focused on that aspect of the proposal.

> **Changes since the first review**
>
> - We now specify that the `#file` string will have the format
`<module-name>/<file-name>` (with a second form for future expansion) and
discuss how to parse it. The previous revision left this format as a compiler
implementation detail that tools should always treat as opaque.
> - We now discuss the behavior of `#sourceLocation`'s `file` parameter and
provide for a warning when it creates conflicts. The previous revision did not
discuss these topics.
> - We now mention the need for tooling to map `#file` strings back to paths.
> - We now provide for a warning when a wrapper around a `#filePath`-defaulting
function passes it `#file` instead, or vice versa. The previous revision did
not discuss this.
> - We have added several suggestions from the first review to the
"alternatives considered" section to explain why we aren't proposing them.

[SE-0270](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0270-rangeset-and-collection-operations.md): *Add Collection Operations on Noncontiguous Elements* is [under a third review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0270-review-3-add-collection-operations-on-noncontiguous-elements/32839).

> We can use a `Range<Index>` to refer to a group of consecutive positions in a
collection, but the standard library doesn't currently provide a way to refer
to discontiguous positions in an arbitrary collection. I propose the addition
of a `RangeSet` type that can represent any number of positions, along with
collection algorithms that operate on those positions.
>
> There are varied uses for tracking multiple elements in a collection, such as
maintaining the selection in a list of items, or refining a filter or search
result set after getting more input from a user.
>
> The Foundation data type most suited for this purpose, `IndexSet`, uses
integers only, which limits its usefulness to arrays and other random-access
collection types. The standard library is missing a collection that can
efficiently store ranges of indices, and is missing the operations that you
might want to perform with such a collection. These operations themselves can
be challenging to implement correctly, and have performance traps as well â€” see
last year's [Embracing Algorithms](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2018/?id=223)
WWDC talk for a demonstration.

### Swift Forums

[Frederick Kellison-Linn](https://twitter.com/jumhyn) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/allow-chained-member-references-in-implicit-member-expressions/32829)
to allow chained member references in implicit member expressions.

> I propose that we extend implicit member syntax (a.k.a. "leading dot syntax")
to allow for chained member references rather than just a single level.
>
> When the type of an expression is implied by the context, Swift allows
developers to use what is formally referred to as an "implicit member
expression", sometimes referred to as "leading dot syntax":

```swift
class C {
    static let zero = C(0)
    var x: Int

    init(_ x: Int) {
        self.x = x
    }
}

func f(_ c: C) {
    print(c.x)
}

f(.zero) // prints '0'
```

> However, attempting to use this with a chain of member references fails:

```swift
extension C {
    var incremented: C {
        return C(self.x + 1)
    }
}

f(.zero.incremented) // Error: Type of expression is ambiguous without more context
```

> On master, the new diagnostic system has improved the produced error:

```swift
f(.zero.incremented) // Error: Cannot infer contextual base in reference to member 'zero'
```

> but the same problem persists.

[Yuta Koshizawa](https://twitter.com/koher) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/three-steps-to-variadic-generics/33154):
Three Steps to Variadic Generics.

> Variadic generics was referred to in "[On the road to Swift 6](https://forums.swift.org/t/on-the-road-to-swift-6/32862)".
I think it may be a good idea to break down it into the following three steps
compared to tackle variadic generics directly.
> 
> 1. Operations for tuples
> 2. Variadic tuples
> 3. Variadic generics

[Fabian Fett](https://twitter.com/fabianfett) announced [official platform support for other Linux
Distributions](https://forums.swift.org/t/official-platform-support-for-other-linux-distributions-and-a-case-for-amazon-linux-2/33167)
(besides Ubuntu).

> The SSWG announced that they are looking for other Linux Distributions
besides Ubuntu to support official prebuilt toolchains for in [their yearly
update](https://swift.org/blog/sswg-update/).
>
> After some research the only documented way I found to engage in widening the
platform support is by [administering a Jenkins slave](https://github.com/apple/swift-community-hosted-continuous-integration)
that builds Swift on a given platform as part of the Community-CI effort.<br />
Sadly administering such a slave comes with at least a monetary burden (besides
time and security).
>
> For this reason I want to ask: What will the process be to become an
officially supported platform? If there is no process planned so far maybe we
can start a discussion here.

[Rahul Malik](https://twitter.com/rmalik) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/swiftpm-support-for-swift-scripts/33126)
to add SwiftPM support for Swift scripts.

> Swift is a general-purpose language that aims expand it's availability and
impact on various domains and platforms. We believe great scripting support and
experience is an important part of improving the impact of Swift as a language.
Swift already includes basic support for scripting via the Swift command-line
tool. This is a proposal for greatly improving the script support by providing
a deeper integration with the Swift Package Manager.

[Steve Canon](https://twitter.com/stephentyrone) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/add-float16/33019)
to add `Float16`.

> Introduce the `Float16` type conforming to the `BinaryFloatingPoint` and
`SIMDScalar` protocols, binding the IEEE 754 *binary16* format (aka *float16*,
*half-precision*, or *half*), and bridged by the compiler to the C `_Float16`
type.

[David Hart](https://twitter.com/dhartbit) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-manager-localized-resources/32963)
to add Localized Resources to the Swift Package Manager.

> This proposal builds on top of the [Package Manager Resources](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0271-package-manager-resources.md)
proposal to allow defining localized versions of resources in the SwiftPM
manifest and have them automatically accessible at runtime using the same APIs.

[Nikhil Pandey](https://forums.swift.org/u/nikhilpandey4) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/more-push-towards-distribution-and-promotion-of-the-server-side-swift-framework/32931)
for a push towards distribution and promotion of the Server Side Swift
Framework.

> Lots of efforts are being made for creation of new frameworks and creating
new libraries since last few years for making Swift on Server Side a real
success, which is commendable. Let's also accept the fact that Server Side
Swift is also something which requires cooperation and support of wider
developer community outside Apple ecosystem too, especially on Linux side and,
so cooperation with external developers is also a requirement.
>
> A time has come for putting efforts also towards promotion and distribution
of Server Side Swift too.

[Owen Voorhees](https://twitter.com/owenvoorhees) shared [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-driver-and-help-documentation-lookup/32881)
on `swift-driver` and `â€“help` / documentation lookup.

> In short, I think we should consider adding writing a `swift-help` in Swift
as part of the `swift-driver` project, and use it to entirely replace help
handling in the compiler sooner rather than later. The benefits are:
>
> - We'd gain experience integrating a Swift package product in compiler
toolchains with minimal impact on day-to-day development. Anything we learned
could then be applied to `swift-driver` later on. No bootstrapping would be
needed since the help text isn't needed to build the compiler.
> - `swift help` becomes a supported subcommand
> - It solves my immediate problem (admittedly not a strong justification)
> - We could delete a little bit of C++ from the frontend :)

[Nevin](https://forums.swift.org/u/nevin) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/set-only-subscripts/32858)
to add support for set-only subscripts.

> Currently, subscripts can be read-only or they can be read-write, but there
is no way to declare a subscript as write-only. Write-only subscripts have a
number of important uses, and this proposal aims to bring them into the
language.
