Quite a lot of work has been done to implement recently accepted Swift Evolution proposals, as well as improving their diagnostics and error messages. Interestingly, some of this work has been done by first-time contributors, which is amazing to see!

### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 9: [String Manifesto](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/67089)

This week JP Simard and Jesse Squires discuss the String Manifesto!

### Commits and pull requests

Slava Pestov [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9090) [SE-0156](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0156-subclass-existentials.md): *Class and Subtype existentials*.

Brent Royal-Gordon [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9148) to improve diagnostics for multi-line string literals ([SE-0168](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0168-multi-line-string-literals.md)).

Brian King [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9098) [SE-0169](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0169-improve-interaction-between-private-declarations-and-extensions.md): *Improve Interaction Between `private` Declarations and Extensions*. 🚀

Robert Widmann has redone [exhaustiveness checking](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/8908), fixing a *lot* of SR-bugs in the process.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0170](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0170-nsnumber_bridge.md): *NSNumber bridging and Numeric types* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170424/036226.html) for Swift 4.

[SE-0173](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0173-swap-indices.md): *Add `MutableCollection.swapAt(_:_:)`* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170424/036229.html) with revisions and has also been implemented.

> The proposal is accepted, including the revision to change the method name from `swap(_:with:)` to `swapAt(_:_)` that came out of the Core Team meeting.
>
> The consensus on `swift-evolution` was to add the method, with division mostly on the naming of the method. The Core Team reviewed the proposed options as well as consulted [the API design guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) to resolve the issue.
>
> Two important points from the guidelines serve to us well here:
>
> "Omit all labels when arguments can’t be usefully distinguished”
>
> and:
>
> "When the first argument forms part of a prepositional phrase, give it an argument label... An exception arises when the first two arguments represent parts of a single abstraction. In such cases, begin the argument label after the preposition, to keep the abstraction clear."
>
> The combination of these rules leads to the method name `swapAt(_:_:)`, which the Core Team believes was most in line with the guidelines.

[SE-0176](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0176-enforce-exclusive-access-to-memory.md): *Enforce Exclusive Access to Memory* by John McCall is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-May/000372.html).

> In Swift 3, it is possible to modify a variable while it's being used or modified by another part of the program. This can lead to unexpected and confusing results. It also forces a great deal of conservatism onto the implementation of the compiler and the standard libraries, which must generally ensure the basic soundness of the program (no crashes or undefined behavior) even in unusual circumstances.
>
> We propose that Swift should instead enforce a general rule that potential modifications of variables must be exclusive with any other access to that variable.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0174](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0174-filter-range-replaceable.md): *Change `filter` to return an associated type* by Ben Cohen is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000370.html).

> This proposal changes the `filter` operation on `Sequence` to return an associated type, and adds a default implementation to `RangeReplaceableCollection` to return the same type as the filtered collection.
>
> The recently accepted [SE-0165](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0165-dict.md) introduced a version of `filter` on `Dictionary` that returned a `Dictionary`. This had both performance and usability benefits: in most cases, a `Dictionary` is what the user wanted from the filter, and creating one directly from the filter operation is much more efficient than first creating an array then creating a `Dictionary` from it.
>
> However, this does result in some inconsistencies. Users may be surprised that this one specific collection returns `Self`, while other collections that would benefit from the same change still return `[Element]`. And some collections, such as `String`, might also benefit from usability and performance win similar to `Dictionary`. Additionally, these wins will be lost in generic code – if you pass a `Dictionary` into an algorithm that takes a `Sequence`, then when you filter it, you will still get an `Array`.

[SE-0175](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0175-package-manager-revised-dependency-resolution.md): *Package Manager Revised Dependency Resolution* by Rick Ballard is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-May/000373.html).

> This proposal makes the package manager's dependency resolution behavior clearer and more intuitive. It removes the pinning commands (`swift package pin` & `swift package unpin`), replaces the `swift package fetch` command with a new `swift package resolve` command with improved behavior, and replaces the optional `Package.pins` file with a `Package.resolved` file which is always created during dependency resolution.

### Mailing lists

There has once again been some discussion around `Optional`, `throws` and the `Result` type. Although we probably won't see changes here [in the near future](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170501/036353.html), it's interesting to see this keeps resurfacing and the ideas maturing.

Doug Gregor [writes](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170501/036353.html):

> [..] the current error-handling system will not be going away, for the reasons Jaden has stated [above](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170501/036345.html).
>
> Maybe we will grow typed throws at some point; maybe `Result` will get added to the standard library with some nice affordances to map between `throw`ing and `Result`-producing types; but we’re well beyond the point where we can rip out major features that have been generally well-received.

In the earlier discussion on revamping `Optional` and `throws`, John McCall [writes](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170501/036256.html):

> We've definitely considered including a `Result` type, but our sense was that in an ideal world almost no code would be using it.  It's hard to imagine an ordinary API that ought to be returning a `Result` rather than `throw`ing, and once you've defined that away, the major remaining use case is just to shift computation around, like with a completion handler. That explicit computation-shifting pattern is something we're hoping to largely define away with something like `C#`'s `async`/`await`, which would leave `Result` as mostly just an implementation detail of such APIs. We didn't want to spend a great deal of time designing a type that would end up being so marginal, especially if the changing role would lead us into different directions on the design itself. We also didn't want to design a type that would become an obstacle to potential future language changes like, say, typed `throws`.
>
> The downside, of course, is that as long as we lack that `async`/`await` design, computation-shifting isn't real great.

### Finally

And finally — Xcode might not be [as genius as you think](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/859832487719182343). 🤔
