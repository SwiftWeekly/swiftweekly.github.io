The last two weeks were somewhat slow in the Swift open source world but then Apple published yet another open-source library - [Swift Service Discovery](https://github.com/apple/swift-service-discovery). Apart from the announcement of the new iPhones we had some weird times with Xcode 12.1 and 12.2 beta 3 🤔.

To continue sending out this newsletter to your emails, we are looking for sponsors to cover the cost of the platform we are using. More info about that can be found [here](https://swiftweekly.github.io/sponsorship/). Or you can reach out to me personally on Twitter [@fassko](https://twitter.com/fassko). Thanks! 🙏

### Podcasts

In the latest episode of Swift Unwrapped, [Jesse](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires)
and [JP](https://twitter.com/simjp) talk [about
Implementing the Swift Runtime in Swift](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/1DMLbJg5), with [Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN).

### News and community

[Yim Lee](https://github.com/yim-lee/) wrote [a blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-service-discovery/) to announce a new open-source project for the Swift Server ecosystem, [Swift Service Discovery](https://github.com/apple/swift-service-discovery).

The vapor team announced notable [core team changes](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/2507).

[David Smith](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man) tweeted a refresher about [copy-on-write values in Swift](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/1318448928048623616).

### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://github.com/slavapestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/34246) that removes 3 of our name lookup implementations in favor of the shiny new `ASTScope`, the 4th implementation to rule them all. Now, 1 is gone entirely and 1 is off by default. Also, this six-year old (!) feature request fell out easily. This fixes [SR-10069](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-10069).

[Zoe Carver](https://github.com/zoecarver) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33053) that adds rudimentary support for C++ template functions in Swift.

[Keith Smiley](https://github.com/keith) created [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/34227) that adds a check validating the current Xcode version is supported for building. It also fixes [SR-13497](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13497).

[Luciano Almeida](https://github.com/LucianoPAlmeida) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/34330) fixes the crash on `simplifyFix` constraint for tuple mismatch and fixes [SR-13732](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13732).

[tbkka](https://github.com/tbkka) created [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15474) that replaces the current implementation of `description` and
`debugDescription` for the standard floating-point types with a new
formatting routine that provides both improved performance and
better results. It fixes multiple bugs - [SR-106](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-106), [SR-454](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-454), [SR-491](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-491), [SR-3131](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3131).

### Swift Forums

[ArtemC](https://forums.swift.org/u/artemc) shared [an update] about [swift-driver](https://github.com/apple/swift-driver) project.

> After its [announcement](https://forums.swift.org/t/new-project-announcement-swift-compiler-driver-reimplementation-in-swift/29696) almost exactly a year ago, the [swift-driver](https://github.com/apple/swift-driver) project is moving full-steam-ahead towards the goal of replacing its C++ predecessor. Recent weeks saw a large amount of activity on the swift-driver repository towards achieving that goal.

[staticVoidMan](https://forums.swift.org/u/staticvoidman) started [a discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/padding-arrays/41041) about proposal to pad `Arrays` till a certain minimum length.

> This will be useful when the array is of an arbitrary length but we need at least some minimum length to work with, so padding the array with default values is a conventional way to handle such a scenario.
>
> ```
> let arr = [10,20,30]
> let res = arr.padding(repeating: 0, inLength: 7)
> print(res) // -> [10,20,30,0,0,0,0]
> ```

[Morten Bek Ditlevsen](https://forums.swift.org/u/morten_bek_ditlevsen) asked [a question](https://forums.swift.org/t/requesting-help-with-stdlib-testing/41198) how to test `stdlib`. [Lot](https://forums.swift.org/t/requesting-help-with-stdlib-testing/41198/2) of [people](https://forums.swift.org/t/requesting-help-with-stdlib-testing/41198/3) [replied](https://forums.swift.org/t/requesting-help-with-stdlib-testing/41198/6) with information that can be helpful in future.

[Frederick Kellison-Linn](https://forums.swift.org/u/jumhyn) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/placeholder-types/41329) about placeholder types (formerly "partial type annotations").

> When Swift's type inference is unable to work out the type of a particular expression, it requires the programmer to provide the necessary type context explicitly. However, all mechanisms for doing this require the user to write out the entire type signature, even if only one portion of that type is actually needed by the compiler.
