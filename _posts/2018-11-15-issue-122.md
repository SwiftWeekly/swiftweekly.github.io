We're very happy to announce that thanks to [Zigii Wong](https://twitter.com/wongzigii), Swift Weekly Brief will be available in Chinese as well! You can go to the website [here](https://swiftweekly.github.io/cn/), and you can contribute in [this repository](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly/cn). ðŸŽ‰

In other news, there's a potentially highly anticipated proposal in review, namely one that introduces a `Result` type to the Standard Library. ðŸ˜±

... so go ahead and read all about this and more exciting progress on Swift.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-9201](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-9201) [Compiler] Incorrect error message when using optional chaining
- [SR-9216](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-9216) [Compiler] Don't honor SDKROOT in interpreter mode

### Swift Unwrapped

Jesse and JP [discussed](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/222525) Opaque Result Types, as pitched by Doug Gregor on the forums.

### News and community

[Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) wrote [a blog post](https://nshipster.com/language-server-protocol/) about the Language Server Protocol, "arguably the most important decision Apple has made for Swift since releasing the language as open source in 2014".

SwiftNIO is now available [as a CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SwiftNIO)!

Vapor is working on splitting two new libraries out of their core library: [NIOKit](https://github.com/vapor-community/nio-kit) and [CodableKit](https://github.com/vapor-community/codable-kit).

### Commits and pull requests

[David Smith](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/20383) that improves String bridging performance!

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0233](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0233-additive-arithmetic-protocol.md): *Make  `Numeric`  Refine a new  `AdditiveArithmetic`  Protocol* was [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0233-make-numeric-refine-a-new-additivearithmetic-protocol/17583) and then [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0233-make-numeric-refine-a-new-additivearithmetic-protocol/17751/2).

> This proposal introduces a weakening of the existing  `Numeric`  protocol named  `AdditiveArithmetic` , which defines additive arithmetic operators and a zero, making conforming types roughly correspond to the mathematic notion of an [additive group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_group). This makes it possible for vector types to share additive arithmetic operators with scalar types, which enables generic algorithms over `AdditiveArithmetic` to apply to both scalars and vectors.

> Feedback on the proposal was light but all positive, and the proposal was accepted without modifications. The core team discussed moving the unary + member, but ended up agreeing with the proposal as written.

### Returned proposals

[SE-0229](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0229-simd.md): *SIMD Vectors, Take 2* was [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0229-simd-vectors/16518/99).

> The proposal and implementation have been updated.
>
> To summarize how the proposal has changed:
>
> - The primary working types are now spelled like `Vector3<T>` instead of the earlier `T.Vector3`.
> - Initializers from any `Sequence` with the right element type are now provided.
> - All mask operations are `.`-prefixed
> - `count` has been renamed `elementCount`
> - The general swizzle / shuffle / permute operation `init(gathering: at:)` has been removed. We intend to restore it in a later proposal with a better name.
> - Users can make `VectorN<T>` available for arbitrary types `T` by conforming `T` to a new `SIMDVectorizable` protocol, which has very basic requirements.
> - The any and all and `min`, `max`, and `clamp` free functions have been removed. We intend to re-introduce this functionality (possibly with different bindings) in a follow-on proposal.
> - The `IntegerVector` and `FloatingPointVector` protocols have been removed and replaced with conditional conformances.

### Rejected proposals

[SE-0231](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0231-optional-iteration.md): *Optional Iteration* was [rejected](https://forums.swift.org/t/rejected-se-0231-optional-iteration/17805).

> Although the core team agrees that iterating through collections wrapped in `Optional` is a common enough occurrence to be worth providing affordances in the language for, it has decided to reject the proposal as written.

I'd encourage to read the [full rationale](https://forums.swift.org/t/rejected-se-0231-optional-iteration/17805).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0235](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0235-add-result.md): *Add Result to the Standard Library* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0235-add-result-to-the-standard-library/17752).

> Swift's current error-handling, using `throws`, `try`, and `catch`, offers automatic and synchronous handling of errors through explicit syntax and runtime behavior. However, it lacks the flexibility needed to cover all error propagation and handling in the language. `Result` is a type commonly used for manual propagation and handling of errors in other languages and within the Swift community. Therefore this proposal seeks to add such a type to the Swift standard library.

[SE-0236](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0236-package-manager-platform-deployment-settings.md): *Package Manager Platform Deployment Settings* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0236-package-manager-platform-deployment-settings/17992).

> This is a proposal for adding support for specifying a per-platform minimum required deployment target in the `Package.swift` manifest file.
>
> Packages should be able to declare the minimum required platform deployment target version. SwiftPM currently uses a hardcoded value for the macOS deployment target. This creates friction for packages which want to use APIs that were introduced after the hardcoded deployment target version.

### Swift Forums

[Michael Ilseman](https://twitter.com/Ilseman) shared [String's proposed Application Binary Interface (ABI)](https://forums.swift.org/t/string-s-abi-and-utf-8/17676) and that native Swift strings will be stored as UTF-8!

> We just landed Stringâ€™s proposed final ABI on master. This ABI includes some significant changes, the primary one being that native Swift strings are stored as UTF-8 where they were previously stored either as ASCII or UTF-16 depending on their contents. `NSString`s are still lazily bridged in to String without copying.
>
> This does not immediately surface in the API, but allows for some important performance wins and gives a more consistent basis for future APIs providing efficient and direct access to the underlying code units. UTF-8 is a one-byte Unicode encoding and is the preferred encoding for interoperating with C, systems programming, server-side programming, scripting, client-side programming, and tools that process source code and textual formats.

With this change, the Standard Library's binary is around 13% smaller as well!

Vapor is [splitting out](https://forums.swift.org/t/niokit-codablekit/17706) two new libraries from its core library.

> We're starting work on two new packages that will debut with Vapor 4. [NIOKit](https://github.com/vapor-community/nio-kit) and [CodableKit](https://github.com/vapor-community/codable-kit). The goal of these packages is to break out a lot of utilities Vapor has developed over the past two years in our Core 1 repo. This repo has grown quite large and contains a lot of things we think would be useful to the Server community as a whole, not tied to Vapor.

[Johannes Weiss](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss/) shared [the plan](https://forums.swift.org/t/plan-for-nio-2-and-swift-5/17791) for SwiftNIO 2 and how that ties into Swift 5.

> As I'm sure you are aware, the first Swift 5 branches will be cut soon and needless to say SwiftNIO wants to be able to make full use of the new features/improvements upcoming in Swift 5 (for example native UTF8 `String`s). On top that, SwiftNIO already accumulated [a number of issues/[pull requests]](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.0.0) that can only be addressed with a new major SwiftNIO 2.0.0 release.
>
> Our plan is to therefore release SwiftNIO 2.0 together with Swift 5.0. NIO 2 will require Swift 5 and will be a breaking release. Don't expect everything to break when you need to migrate from NIO 1 to NIO 2 but there will be likely a number of things that can hopefully be fixed mostly through search & replace. We will maintain a list of changes with strategies to resolve this.

### Finally

[I](https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift/status/1060266652326027264) love [this](https://twitter.com/HarshilShah1910/status/1061528775337291776) `Result` type!
