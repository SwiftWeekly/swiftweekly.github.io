With WWDC around the corner (it starts in four days!), it is not that big of a surprise that these last two weeks have been pretty quite when it comes to Swift.

Also, come and say hi at WWDC!

### Swift Unwrapped

In [episode 59](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/144991), Jesse and JP discuss implicit escaping of closures, explaining in how they (should) work.

In [episode 60](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/144992), Jesse and JP discuss Character Properties, a proposal pitch that aims to increase the usefulness of `Character` and approachability of programming in Swift.

### News and community

[Michael Ilseman](https://twitter.com/Ilseman) has [improved](https://twitter.com/brentdax/status/1001351681370542080) string interpolation in Swift 4.2 to be at least twice as fast! 🏎💨

### Commits and pull requests

[Alex Hoppen](https://github.com/ahoppen) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/16340) that adds [incremental syntax parsing](https://gist.github.com/ahoppen/3ae1a6cd64e558710a4afcd372e8fdc4) to the Swift compiler. Cool!

[Lily Vulcano](https://github.com/millenomi) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/16022) to bridge `as`, `as?`, and `as!` to Linux. 🎉

[Michael Gottesman](https://github.com/gottesmm) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/16882) to allow for benchmark testing on Linux.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0214](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0214-DictionaryLiteral.md): *Renaming the `DictionaryLiteral` type to `KeyValueList`* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0214-renaming-the-dictionaryliteral-type-to-keyvaluelist/12817).

> This proposal renames the confusing and misnamed [`DictionaryLiteral`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/c25188bafd1c775d4ceecc4a795f614f00451bf9/stdlib/public/core/Mirror.swift#L646) type to `KeyValueList`. This type is neither a dictionary nor a literal. It is a list of key-value pairs.
>
> There is no strong motivation to deprecate. The type does not produce active harm. Instead, it adds measurable (if small) utility and will be part of the ABI. A sensible renaming mitigates the most problematic issue with the type.

### Swift Forums

[Ben Cohen](https://twitter.com/airspeedswift) started [a discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0202-amendment-proposal-rename-random-to-defaultrandomnumbergenerator/12942) to change part of SE-0202, renaming `Random` to `DefaultRandomNumberGenerator`.

> SE-0202, as accepted, introduces a type, `Random`, as the default source of random numbers on each platform.
>
> [..] the name `Random` for this default source is misleading, and would probably be better named `DefaultRandomNumberGenerator`.
>
> One open question is the naming of the getter for an instance of the type. Currently it is `Random.default`. However, renaming `Random` leads to the rather clunky `DefaultRandomNumberGenerator.default`. Benjamin suggests `.shared`. However, in all current implementations, this is not strictly speaking a shared instance – it is instead a getter/setter for a fresh instance each time. This doesn't actually have a cost, since the type has no actual size (the type is just a vehicle for calling an OS function), but needs to be done this way because `using:` is taken `inout`.
>
> Any suggestions for better naming gratefully received.
