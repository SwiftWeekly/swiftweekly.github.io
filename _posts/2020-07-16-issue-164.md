Another two weeks have passed, so here's another "Weekly" Brief. There's lots
of energy within the community at the moment, it seems — as there's a lot going
on.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-13119](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13119) [Compiler] Confusing
diagnostic when checking conformance for IUO of generic parameter
- [SR-13092](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13092) [Parser] `operator $`
produces two contradictory error messages  


### Podcasts

[John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) discusses [what's been going on
with SwiftUI](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/76/) with [Josh Shaffer](https://twitter.com/joshshaffer)
and [Eliza Block](https://twitter.com/elizablock) from Apple.

### News and community

[Tom Doron](https://twitter.com/tomerdoron/) announced [Swift Service Lifecycle](https://swift.org/blog/swift-service-lifecycle/),
a new open source project for the Swift server ecosystem. It is a Swift package
designed to help server applications, also known as services, manage their
startup and shutdown sequences.

### Commits and pull requests

[Mishal Shah](https://twitter.com/mishaldshah) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/32705)
that adds Apple Silicon support to the Swift continuous integration.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0284](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0284-multiple-variadic-parameters.md): *Allow Multiple Variadic Parameters in Functions, Subscripts, and Initializers* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0284-allow-multiple-variadic-parameters-in-functions-subscripts-and-initializers/38225).

> Currently, variadic parameters in Swift are subject to two main restrictions:
>
> - Only one variadic parameter is allowed per parameter list
> - If present, the parameter which follows a variadic parameter must be labeled
>
> This proposal seeks to remove the first restriction while leaving the second
in place, allowing a function, subscript, or initializer to have multiple
variadic parameters so long as every parameter which follows a variadic one
has a label.

[SE-0285](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0285-ease-pound-file-transition.md): *Ease the transition to concise magic file strings* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0285-ease-the-transition-to-concise-magic-file-strings/38234).

> In [SE-0274](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0274-magic-file.md),
the core team accepted a proposal to change the behavior of `#file`. This
proposal modifies that plan to transition into new behavior more gradually,
treating it as a source break requiring a new language version mode to fully
adopt.

### Swift Forums

[Steve Cannon](https://twitter.com/stephentyrone) shared the [release notes](https://forums.swift.org/t/0-0-6-release-notes/38146)
for Swift Numerics 0.0.6.

[Nicholas Maccharoli](https://twitter.com/theloniousMonad) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/revisiting-se-0177-adding-clamped-to/38332)
to revist [SE-0177](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0177-add-clamped-to-method.md): `clamped(to:)`.

> It has been a while since SE-0177 was sent back for revision (three years?)
and it might be worth it to start a new thread here about what to do with
SE-0177.
>
> At the moment I have one pull request for the Swift Evolution repository and
another pull request adding `clamped` as an extension on `Comparable` to the
standard library.
>
> I would love to start this discussion with everyone about what to do next
until
SE-0177 is complete.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/1279292206017200128) pitched
[a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-2-forward-scan-matching-for-trailing-closures/38491)
for forward scan matching for trailing closures.

> [SE-0279 "Multiple Trailing Closures"](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0279-multiple-trailing-closures.md)
threaded the needle between getting the syntax we wanted for multiple trailing
closures without breaking source compatibility. One aspect of that compromise
was to extend (rather than replace) the existing rule for matching a trailing
closure to a parameter by scanning backward from the end of the parameter list.
>
> I propose that we replace the backward scan used by the trailing closure
matching rules with a forward scan, which is simpler and works better for APIs
that support trailing closures (whether single or multiple) as well as default
arguments. This is a source-breaking change that affects a small amount of
code: I propose that we take the first (smallest) part of this source break
immediately, to be finished by a slightly larger source break in Swift 6.

> To get a feel for the new behavior, it really helps to write some code against
it. I [implemented this proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/32891)
in the Swift compiler, and have built both a [Linux](https://ci.swift.org/job/swift-PR-toolchain-Linux/389//artifact/branch-master/swift-PR-32891-389-ubuntu16.04.tar.gz)
and a [macOS](https://ci.swift.org/job/swift-PR-toolchain-osx/558//artifact/branch-master/swift-PR-32891-558-osx.tar.gz)
toolchain that support it. [Using this toolchain](https://swift.org/download/#using-downloads),
you can experiment with the new behavior. Please try it out!

[Suyash Srijan](https://twitter.com/suyashsrijan) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/missing-super-call-warning/38177)
to add a missing `super` call warning.

> Introduce a new attribute to warn when an overridden function does not call
the `super` method in its body.
>
> It is quite common to override a method in order to add additional
functionality to it, rather than to completely replace it.
>
> At present, there is no way to communicate this need other than adding it to
the documentation and even experienced developers sometimes overlook this
small detail and later run into various issues at runtime.
>
> In Objective-C, one can annotate a superclass method with the [`objc_requires_super`](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#objc-requires-super)
attribute and the compiler emits a warning when an overridden method is missing
a call to the `super` method in its body.
>
> However, there is no such attribute in Swift.

[Erica Sadun](https://twitter.com/ericasadun) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/proposing-to-expand-available-to-introduce-discouraged/38197)
to expand `available` to introduce `discouraged`.

> Swift's `available` attribute documents characteristics of a declaration's
lifecycle. The attribute specifies when a declaration became available on a
given platform, and if it's been deprecated, obsoleted, or renamed. We feel
there's room to further nuance `available`. This proposal expands `available`
to introduce `discouraged`, making declarations harder to accidentally use.

[chrisbia](https://forums.swift.org/u/chrisbia/summary) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/enabling-safe-non-optional-circular-referencing-with-shared-reference-counts/38200)
to enable safe, non-optional, circular referencing with shared reference counts.

> I don't often come across a data modeling problem where circular referencing
appears to be a good solution. In general I find that arguments that attempt to
justify circular references appear contrived (`Apartment <-> Person`), and
because of that lacking any true real world applicability. That said, circular
referencing isn't always an attempt at a data modeling solution, more often
than not I find it's an attempt at an encapsulation solution.
>
> Often when defining complex models code files can become large and in an
effort to make the repository more digestible functionality and properties are
encapsulated into smaller bite-sized classes. The problem arises when some of
those bite-sized classes require access to data within the original scope.

[Andrew Arnopoulos](https://forums.swift.org/u/andrew_arnopoulos/summary) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/proposal-allow-property-wrappers-with-multiple-arguments-to-defer-initialization-when-wrappedvalue-is-not-specified/38319)
to allow property wrappers with multiple arguments to defer initialization when
a `wrappedValue` is not specified.

> Swift's Property Wrappers allow for wrappers without arguments to defer
specifying the wrappedValue until the initialization of the containing type.
This proposal adds this feature to Property Wrappers that have multiple
arguments by extending the current initializer synthesization.

[Danny Sung](https://forums.swift.org/u/dannys42/summary) pitched [a proposal(https://forums.swift.org/t/invert-guard-let-scoping/38401)
to invert `guard let` scoping.

> I'm proposing the introduction of an inverted scope for the `guard let`
pattern. The problem occurs most commonly when propagating errors to completion
handlers.
