If you haven't heard about it yet, we've been seeing a start to `async` /
`await` in Swift these past two weeks. While this will take a _lot_ more time
before we can expect to see this land in Swift, it is an exciting thing to see.

### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33147)
that adds `async` to the Swift type system.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33196)
stubbing out an experimental concurrency support library.

[Ben Langmuir](https://twitter.com/benlangmuir) merged [a pull request]https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/pull/298)
that contains a big speedup for code-completion in SourceKit-LSP.

[Nate Cook](https://twitter.com/nnnnnnnn) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser/pull/123),
allowing for autocompletion in the Swift argument parser.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0286](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0286-forward-scan-trailing-closures.md): *Forward-scan matching for trailing closures* was [accepted with modifications](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0286-forward-scan-for-trailing-closures/38836).

> Initial feedback on the review was generally positive on the concept, but
several reviewers were troubled by the potential for source incompatibilities.
The proposal author investigated options for maintaining compatibility better,
and when they seemed to work out, the core team elected to amend the proposal
during review. The community then expressed strong support for the revised
proposal, and the feeling among reviewers was that there was no need for a
second review. The core team discussed this and agreed. Accordingly, the
revised proposal is accepted with modifications.

[SE-0285](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0285-ease-pound-file-transition.md): *Ease the transition to concise magic file strings* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0285-ease-the-transition-to-concise-magic-file-strings/38516).

> The feedback was generally positive, and to address the concern around which
variants of `#file` library authors should use the proposal was modified to
include [Swift API Design Guidelines amendment](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0285-ease-pound-file-transition.md#swift-api-design-guidelines-amendment)
encouraging library authors to prefer `#fileID` over alternatives.

[SE-0284](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0284-multiple-variadic-parameters.md): *Allow Multiple Variadic Parameters in Functions, Subscripts, and Initializers* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0284-allow-multiple-variadic-parameters-in-functions-subscripts-and-initializers/38567).

> Some reviewers indicated that they would prefer to format code in certain
ways to aid with legibility, but the functionality itself was well received.
The core team noted that this was an oversight in the original implementation
and should have been permitted in the original implementation.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0286](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0286-forward-scan-trailing-closures.md): *Forward-scan matching for trailing closures* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0286-forward-scan-for-trailing-closures/38529).

> [SE-0279 "Multiple Trailing Closures"](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0279-multiple-trailing-closures.md)
threaded the needle between getting the syntax we wanted for multiple trailing
closures without breaking source compatibility. One aspect of that compromise
was to extend (rather than replace) the existing rule for matching a trailing
closure to a parameter by scanning *backward* from the end of the parameter
list.
>
> However, the backward-scan matching rule makes it hard to write good API that
uses trailing closures, especially multiple trailing closures. This proposal
replaces the backward scan with a forward scan wherever possible, which is
simpler, more in line with normal argument matching in a call, and works better
for APIs that support trailing closures (whether single or multiple) and
default arguments. This change introduces a *minor source break* for code
involving multiple, defaulted closure parameters, but that source break is
staged over multiple Swift versions.

### Swift Forums

Karl pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/shared-substrings/38547) 
for Shared Substrings.

> Shared Substrings give us a way to interpret buffers of bytes as unicode
text, without allocating new storage exclusively owned by a `String` object.
It would, for example, allow developers to receive data from a file or network
connection as an `Array<UInt8>` or Foundation `Data` object, and parse that
data as text without copying it. Additionally, it gives developers of
structured text objects (like URLs) greater control over how they organise
their storage.

[Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-manager-source-archive-dependencies/38626)
to support non-binary source dependencies in the Swift Package Manager.

> Swift Package Manager added support for binary dependencies with [SE-0272](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0272-swiftpm-binary-dependencies.md).
This proposal extends that functionality to support non-binary source
dependencies as well.
>
> Swift Package Manager requires a source dependency to be hosted in a Git
repository with a package manifest located in its root. This can cause
problems for projects with a different directory structure or that use a
version control system other than Git.

[Harshil Shah](https://twitter.com/_HarshilShah) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/lazy-filter-subscripts/38743)
for Lazy Filter Subscripts.

> In playing around with the standard library‚Äôs `Sequence` types, I noticed an
unexpected behaviour.
>
> The current implementation of `LazyFilterCollection` uses the indices of the
base collection as its own, and also forwards any subscripts directly to the
base collection.
>
> This means that it is possible to retrieve values via subscripting that
shouldn‚Äôt exist in the filtered collection:

```swift
let evenDigits = Array(0 ..< 10).lazy.filter { $0.isMultiple(of: 2) }
print(evenDigits[3]) // prints 3
```

> And it also means that indices which don‚Äôt exist in the filtered collection
can be subscripted:

```swift
let evenDigits = Array(0 ..< 10).lazy.filter { $0.isMultiple(of: 2) }
print(evenDigits[5])               // prints 5
print(Array(eventDigits[5...]))    // prints [6, 8]
```

> This behaviour isn‚Äôt currently documented.

[Justin Reusch](https://twitter.com/reuschj) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/memoization-of-swift-properties/38783)
to allow Memoization of Swift properties.

> Swift has a focus on being fast and efficient. To this goal, the memoization
of computed properties would help to speed up some Swift programs relying on
computed values (especially expensive ones) by only re-calculating the results
when one of the properties they depend on has changed.
>
> Anyone familiar with React and React hooks will know one of the most useful
hooks is [React's `useMemo`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo),
which provides this exact functionality for rendering UIs. While memoization
would be broadly applicable to any Swift program, it may be especially helpful
for use in SwiftUI, where preventing unnecessary re-renders can help optimize
app performance.
