Welcome to issue #26! This week was pretty light. Activity is somewhat winding down, presumably in preparation for [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) next week. I'll be skipping the issue next week during the conference and will resume the week after. Hope to see you there!

Also, I forgot to mention last week that it was [Swift's 2nd birthday](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon/status/738379261107523584)! (And it's rude to [force-unwrap Swift on its birthday](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/738518275194159107). ðŸ˜‚)

### Commits and pull requests

The [Swift 3.0 Preview 1](https://github.com/apple/swift/milestones/Swift%203.0%20Preview%201) milestone has grown to 98 (closed) issues. We're still waiting on the first official Swift 3.0 preview. My guess is that this will be announced at WWDC. ðŸ˜‰

**@karwa** [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2912) a `-toolchain` option to `swiftc`. *"This works like clang/gcc's `-B` flag (which allows specifying an alternate toolchain location)."*

Chris Williams [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2929) proposal [SE-0093](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0093-slice-base.md): *Adding a public `base` property to slices*.

Erik Eckstein [optimized](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2845) the mangling of specialized generic functions.

Robert Widmann [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2924) a Clang-like warning if source control conflict markers are detected during lexing.

### Accepted proposals

Erica Sadun's and Chris Lattner's proposal, [SE-0099](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0099-conditionclauses.md): *Restructuring Condition Clauses*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000184.html) **with revision** for Swift 3.

> There was near unanimous agreement that the Swift 2 grammar was inconsistent and ambiguous and should be changed; most of the disagreement centered on how. Many alternatives were discussed, [...]
>
> Of these alternatives, the core team found the last one to be the best choice. `case` and `let` conditions should each specify a single declaration, comma should remain the condition separator, and the `where` keyword can be retired from its purpose as a boolean condition introducer. Some code becomes more verbose, but in common formatting patterns, it aligns more nicely, as in:
>
{% highlight swift %}
   guard
     let x = foo(),
     let y = bar(),
     let z = bas(),
     x == y || y == z else {
   }
{% endhighlight %}
>
> and though it breaks commonality between `let` conditions and `let` declarations, it's more important to preserve higher-level consistency throughout the language in how components of expressions and statements are separated.

### Proposals in review

Austin Zheng's and Becca Royal-Gordon's proposal, [SE-0089](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0089-rename-string-reflection-init.md): *Renaming `String.init<T>(_: T)`*, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-June/000183.html) once again, after having been [returned for revision](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160523/019018.html).

> Swift's `String` type ships with a large number of initializers that take one unlabeled argument. One of these initializers, defined as `init<T>(_: T)`, is used to create a string containing the textual representation of an object. It is very easy to write code which accidentally invokes this initializer by accident, when one of the other synonymous initializers was desired. Such code will compile without warnings and can be very difficult to detect.

### Mailing lists

Not from the Swift mailing lists but LLVM, Renato Golin discussed [moving LLVM to GitHub](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/100310.html). Chris Lattner [supported the idea](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/100314.html). While not *directly* related to daily Swift development since mechanisms are in place to sync [swift-llvm](https://github.com/apple/swift-llvm) with upstream, I imagine this could have a huge impact on contributions to LLVM.
