Welcome to the 113th issue of Swift Weekly Brief! This week was more calm, no news explosions. The repositories and Swift.org discussions had their usual activity.

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-8135](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8135) [Package Manager] SwiftPM should only check for `clang` if it is needed
- [SR-8137](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8137) [Package Manager] Provide mechanism to disable color diagnostics from commands
- [SR-8138](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8138) [Package Manager] Mechanism to limit the parallelism of `swift test --parallel`
- [SR-8139](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8139) [Package Manager] Executable init template is broken when there is a dash in package name
- [SR-8173](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8172) [Tooling] `(T)` Reported as Single-Element Tuple Rather Than `T`
- [SR-8190](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8190) [Standard Library] Introduce a RingBuffer to the Standard Library
- [SR-8204](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8204) [Package Manager] Sort targets in SwiftPM generated Xcode project
- [SR-8222](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8222) [Swift for TensorFlow] `PartitionCloner::visitCondBranchInst()` should be generalized to handle `TensorHandle<Bool>` in addition to `TensorHandle<Builtin.i1>`

### Swift Unwrapped

In [episode 65](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/160476), Jesse and JP discuss the [SE-0213: Literal initialization via coercion](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0213-literal-init-via-coercion.md) proposal and its implementation.

### News and community

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r) noticed the right thing: when `Codable` is awesome, it requires [so much boilerplate](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/1655/files#diff-31d171cad93e680d3ffc6cb3c4fc6848R13) to support enums. It would be great if the compiler could synthesize it, like with `Hashable` and `Equatable`.

### Commits and pull requests

[Mark Lacey](https://github.com/rudkx) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17691) to remove Swift 3 from the type checker. "Goodbye, Swift 3"

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged several pull requests: [#17611](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17611), [#17651](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17651) and [#17816](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17816) - great additions to [SE-0156: Class and Subtype existentials](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0156-subclass-existentials.md) to add support for protocols with superclass constraints.

[Tony Allevato](https://github.com/allevato) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15593) to add Unicode properties to `Unicode.Scalar`. This implements [SE-0211](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0211-unicode-scalar-properties.md), *Add Unicode Properties to `Unicode.Scalar`*.

### Accepted proposals

An amendment to [SE-0202](https://github.com/jckarter/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0202-random-unification.md): *Random Unification* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/amendment-to-se-0202-removing-collection-randomelement-as-a-customization-point/14101).

> We decided to accept the proposed amendment to remove `randomElement` as a customization point.

[SE-0216](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0216-dynamic-callable.md): *User-defined dynamically callable types* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-216-user-defined-dynamically-callable-types/14110).

> Feedback on the proposal was almost entirely positive on both the idea of supporting dynamically-typed calls and the proposal's specific approach to providing that support.
>
> Therefore, the proposal was accepted without modifications.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0217](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0217-bangbang.md): *Introducing the `!!` "Unwrap or Die" operator to the Swift Standard Library* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0217-the-unwrap-or-die-operator/14107).

> This proposal introduces an annotating forced-unwrapping operator to the Swift standard library. It augments the `?`, `??`, and `!` family, adding `!!`. This "unwrap or die" operator provides code-sourced rationales for failed unwraps, supporting self-documentation and safer development. The `!!` operator is commonly implemented in the wider Swift Community and should be considered for official adoption.
>
> The new operator benefits both experienced and new Swift users. It takes this form:

{% highlight swift %}
let value = wrappedValue !! <# "Explanation why lhs cannot be nil." #>
{% endhighlight %}

[SE-0218](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0218-introduce-compact-map-values.md): *Introduce `compactMapValues` to `Dictionary`* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0218-introduce-compactmapvalues-to-dictionary/14266).

> This proposal adds a combined `filter`/`map` operation to `Dictionary`, as a companion to the `mapValues` and `filter` methods introduced by [SE-0165](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0165-dict.md). The new `compactMapValues` operation corresponds to `compactMap` on `Sequence`.

[SE-0219](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0219-package-manager-dependency-mirroring.md): *Package Manager Dependency Mirroring* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0219-package-manager-dependency-mirroring/14371).

> A dependency mirror refers to an alternate source location which exactly replicates the contents of the original source.
>
> Dependency mirroring is useful for several reasons:
>
> - **Availability**: Mirrors can ensure that a dependency can be always fetched, in case the original source is unavailable or even deleted.
> - **Cache**: Access to the original source location could be slow or forbidden in the current environment.
> - **Validation**: Mirrors can help with screening the upstream updates before making them available internally within a company.

### Swift Forums

[Tony Parker]() started [a pitch](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-move-urlsession-to-new-foundationnetworking-module/14002) to move `URLSession` and related types to a new library.

> Some of the feedback we've received from the SwiftNIO team is that Foundation's dependency on `libcurl` brings in too many other libraries.
>
> I propose moving the networking types (except `URL` and `URLComponents`) into another library, with a working name of `swift-corelibs-foundation-networking`.
>
> Benefits:
>
> - SwiftNIO would be able to use core Foundation types.
> - `swift-corelibs-foundation-networking` could use SwiftPM to build itself.
> - Other projects that wish to maintain a minimum set of dependencies and do not need networking support can reduce their footprint.

### Finally

[I wonder if it runs Swift?](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/1016534163988496384) ðŸ¤”
