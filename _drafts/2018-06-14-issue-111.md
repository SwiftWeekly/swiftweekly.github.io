Hi there SwiftWeekly readers! The last two weeks were full of exciting news with WWDC, interesting discussions on the Swift Unwrapped podcast and there's plenty of new starter tasks for you, especially for SPM. Enjoy!

<!--excerpt-->

### Swift Unwrapped

In [episode 61](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/154581), Jesse and JP with special guest Greg Heo discussed general announcements from WWDC 2018, not just limited to the Swift language.

In [episode 62](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/154699), Jesse and JP talk with [Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek), the Swift Project Lead and manager of the Languages and Runtimes team at Apple.

### News and community

The biggest news from past two weeks is, of course, WWDC. There are plenty of videos to watch, but take take a closer look into these Swift related videos:

- [What's New in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/401)
- [Swift Generics](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/406/)
- [Getting to Know Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/411/)
- [Behind the Scenes of the Xcode Build Process](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/415/)

[Ole Begemann](https://github.com/ole) made an easy-to-use [playground](https://github.com/ole/whats-new-in-swift-4-2) to test all new Swift 4.2 features by yourself. If you prefer to read about it, check out Cosmin Pupăză's article [What’s New in Swift 4.2?](https://www.raywenderlich.com/194066/whats-new-in-swift-4-2).

Greg Heo wrote a new post on SwiftUnboxed, [Swift Diagnostics: #warning and #error](https://swiftunboxed.com/internals/diagnostics-warning-error/), about the new `#warning` and `#error` directive implementations.

[Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache) wrote the second part of a [great article](https://modocache.io/swift-compiler-diagnostics-part-2) about the interaction between the Swift frontend and LLVM in terms of emitting diagnostics.

### Commits and pull requests

[Erik Eckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein) [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17014) optimizations for generation of optimal code for static String constants.

Xcode 10 Beta is now required to build `master` and `swift-4.2-branch`: [#17000](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17000) and [#17001](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17001).

[Adrian Prantl](https://github.com/adrian-prantl) [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/16937) "Use depth and index to lookup type metadata artificial variables". The general purpose: "debug info support for generics is about to get a whole lot better".

[Slava Pestov](https://github.com/slavapestov) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17080) availability of inherited designated initializers. 
> Inherited designated initializers got the same availability as the corresponding initialier in the superclass. However if the superclass was more available than the subclass, we would generate a diagnostic that a member cannot be more available than its containing type. This diagnostic had an unknown source location, since the location was for a synthesized declaration, causing confusion.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0215](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0215-conform-never-to-hashable-and-equatable.md): *Conform `Never` to `Equatable` and `Hashable`* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0215-conform-never-to-equatable-and-hashable/13586).

> `Never` is very useful for representing impossible code. Most people are familiar with it as the return type of functions like `fatalError`, but `Never` is also useful when working with generic classes.
>
> For example, a `Result` type might use `Never` for its `Value` to represent something that _always_ errors or use `Never` for its `Error` to represent something that _never_ errors.
>
> Conditional conformances to `Equatable` and `Hashable` are also very useful when working with `enum`s so you can test easily or work with collections.
>
> But those don’t play well together. Without conformance to `Equatable` and `Hashable`, `Never` disqualifies your generic type from being `Equatable` and `Hashable`.

[SE-0216](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0216-dynamic-callable.md) *Introduce user-defined dynamically "callable" types* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0216-user-defined-dynamically-callable-types/13615).

> This proposal is a follow-on to [SE-0195 - Introduce User-defined "Dynamic Member
Lookup" Types](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0195-dynamic-member-lookup.md)
which shipped in Swift 4.2. It introduces a new `@dynamicCallable` attribute, which marks
a type as being "callable" with normal syntax. 
>
> [...]
>
> Swift is exceptional at interworking with existing C and Objective-C APIs and we would like to extend this interoperability to dynamic languages like Python, JavaScript, Perl, and Ruby. We explored this overall goal in a long design process wherein the Swift evolution community evaluated multiple different implementation approaches. The conclusion was that the best approach was to put most of the complexity into dynamic language specific bindings written as pure-Swift libraries, but add small hooks in Swift to allow these bindings to provide a natural experience to their clients.

### Finally

And finally &mdash; [time to get some rest](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/1005500623175815168)!
