### Swift Unwrapped

In [episode 61](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/154581), Jesse and JP with special guest Greg Heo are discussing general announcements from WWDC 2018 not just limited to the Swift language.

In [episode 62](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/154699), Jesse and JP are taking an interview from [Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) - manager of the languages and runtimes team at Apple

### News and community

The biggest news from past two weeks is, of course, WWDC. There are plenty of videos you want to watch, but take take a closer look into these Swift related videos:
- [What's New in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/401)
- [Swift Generics](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/406/)
- [Getting to Know Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/411/)
- [Behind the Scenes of the Xcode Build Process](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/415/)

[Ole Begemann](https://github.com/ole) made an easy-to-use [playground](https://github.com/ole/whats-new-in-swift-4-2) to test all new Swift 4.2 features by yourself. If you prefer to read about it www.raywenderlich.com made the article [What’s New in Swift 4.2?](https://www.raywenderlich.com/194066/whats-new-in-swift-4-2), so you can read all about it without new Xcode 10 beta.

[Swift Diagnostics: #warning and #error](https://swiftunboxed.com/internals/diagnostics-warning-error/) by swiftunboxed gives details about #warning and #error implementation.

[Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache) wrote second part of [great article](https://modocache.io/swift-compiler-diagnostics-part-2) about interaction between Swift frontend and llvm in terms of emiting diagnostics.

### Commits and pull requests

[eeckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein) [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17014) optimizations for generation of optimal code for static String constants.

Xcode 10 Beta now required to build `master` & `swift-4.2-branch`: [Update master to build with Xcode 10 beta 1, OS X 10.14, iOS 12, tvOS 12, and watchOS 5 SDKs](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17000) and [Update 4.2 to build with Xcode 10 beta 1, OS X 10.14, iOS 12, tvOS 12, and watchOS 5 SDKs.](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17001)

[adrian-prantl](https://github.com/adrian-prantl) [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/16937) "Use depth and index to lookup type metadata artificial variables". The general purpose: "debug info support for generics is about to get a whole lot better".

[Slava Pestov](https://github.com/slavapestov) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17080) availability of inherited designated initializers. 
> Inherited designated initializers got the same availability as the corresponding initialier in the superclass. However if the superclass was more available than the subclass, we would generate a diagnostic that a member cannot be more available than its containing type. This diagnostic had an unknown source location, since the location was for a synthesized declaration, causing confusion.

### Accepted proposals

Proposal: Conform `Never` to `Equatable` and `Hashable` - is [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/855) into main repository. 

Proposal: Dynamic Callable (`@dynamicCallable` attribute) - is [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/858) into main repository. This is a follow-up to SE-0195 "Dynamic Member Lookup". The implementation is [ready](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/16980). Pitches: (Pitch: Introduce user-defined dynamically "callable" types.)[https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-introduce-user-defined-dynamically-callable-types/7038], (Pitch #2: Introduce user-defined dynamically “callable” types.)[https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-2-introduce-user-defined-dynamically-callable-types/7112] and current one (Pitch #3: Introduce user-defined dynamically “callable” types)[https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-3-introduce-user-defined-dynamically-callable-types/12232]

### Proposals in review

[SE-0215](SE-0215 - Conform Never to Equatable and Hashable) is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0215-conform-never-to-equatable-and-hashable/13586)
[SE-0216](Introduce user-defined dynamically "callable" types) is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0216-user-defined-dynamically-callable-types/13615)

### Finally

> TODO: something funny/fun. tweet, link, etc.
