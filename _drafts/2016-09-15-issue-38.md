### Starter tasks

The Swift team uses a Python script named `cmpcodesize` to measure the size of Swift build products. Improving that script is one way to contribute to reducing the size of Swift code. If you know some Python, try these tasks:

- [SR-407](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-407): `cmpcodesize` is capable of analyzing the size and segments of macOS Mach-O build products. Complete this task to allow it to analyze code size on Linux, by supporting the ELF object format.
- [SR-2595](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2595): The current output format for `cmpcodesize` can't be easily parsed by other programs, making it hard to measure code size improvements and regressions over time. This task tracks adding additional output formats to `cmpcodesize`, such as CSV.
