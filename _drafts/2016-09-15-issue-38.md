### Starter tasks

The Swift team uses a Python script named `cmpcodesize` to measure the size of Swift build products. Improving that script is one way to contribute to reducing the size of Swift code. If you know some Python, try these tasks:

- [SR-407](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-407): `cmpcodesize` is capable of analyzing the size and segments of macOS Mach-O build products. Complete this task to allow it to analyze code size on Linux, by supporting the ELF object format.
- [SR-2595](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2595): The current output format for `cmpcodesize` can't be easily parsed by other programs, making it hard to measure code size improvements and regressions over time. This task tracks adding additional output formats to `cmpcodesize`, such as CSV.

### Commits and pull requests

Michael Ilseman [refactored](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4706) around 3000 lines of code, reducing the code browsing burden of the ClangImporter.

The one and only Jesse Squires has been at work [separating withdrawn proposals from rejected ones](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/526).

### Proposals in review

Andrew Trick's proposal ([SE-0138](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0138-unsaferawbufferpointer.md)) from last week has been [renamed to `UnsafeRawBufferPointer`](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/523) and its review period was [extended](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-September/000282.html) by one week.

### Mailing lists

Mishal Shah [announced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160905/002883.html) that Swift CI is now capable of testing combinations of pull requests. CI can even test pull requests made to two separate repositories! For example, if Swift PR #123 makes a change to the Swift standard library, and swift-corelibs-foundation PR #456 updates Foundation for that change, the two can be tested together by posting the following comment:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- As a comment on apple/swift pull request #123 -->

Please test with following PR:
https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/456

@swift-ci Please test
{% endhighlight %}
