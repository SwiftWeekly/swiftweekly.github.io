It has been a week since WWDC, and hopefully you've had a chance to see what your Swift 4 upgrade path looks like. Mine started with an increase in redundant protocol conformance warnings, and I found one [minor regression](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5153). That said, it has been pretty smooth so far, especially compared to the 2 weeks I spent on the Swift 3 upgrade last year!

Also, keep in mind that Swift 3.2 is the Swift 4 compiler running in Swift 3 compatibility mode (`-swift-version 3`, which clicked for me sometime during WWDC ðŸ˜…). Understanding this can be really helpful when putting together a ticket for bugs.swift.org.

### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 15: [What's New in Swift 4, Part 2](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/70809)

JP Simard and Jesse Squires continue their discussion on what to expect with Swift 4.

### News and community

John Sundell [wrote about the new Swift 4 `String` APIs](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/exploring-the-new-string-api-in-swift-4). The post includes lots of useful examples that show where you might start using them in your day-to-day Swift.

### Commits and pull requests

Slava Pestov [fixed a bug in Swift 4 and 3.1](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10195) related to superclass initializer delegation where Swift might incorrectly reject a `self.init` call as an escaping use of `self` for certain kinds of superclass initializers.

Devin Coughlin continued work on Swift 4 memory exclusivity by [adding analysis for `inout` params](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10191).
