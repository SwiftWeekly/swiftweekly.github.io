It has been a week since WWDC, and hopefully you've had a chance to see what your Swift 4 upgrade path looks like. Mine started with an increase in redundant protocol conformance warnings, and I found one [minor regression](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5153). That said, it has been pretty smooth so far, especially compared to the 2 weeks I spent on the Swift 3 upgrade last year!

Also, keep in mind that Swift 3.2 is the Swift 4 compiler running in Swift 3 compatibility mode (`-swift-version 3`, which clicked for me sometime during WWDC ðŸ˜…). Understanding this can be really helpful when putting together a ticket for bugs.swift.org.
