### News and community

[Keith Smiley](https://twitter.com/SmileyKeith) [shared](https://forums.swift.org/t/5-5-cherry-pick-triage-process/53574) updates about Swift 5.5 and it's cherry pick triage process.

[John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) wrote [an article](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/count-vs-isEmpty/) exploring how to use count vs `isEmpty` to check whether a collection contains any elements.

[Will Lisac](https://twitter.com/wlisac) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/wlisac/status/1460499369052884992) that [Swift 5.5 Docker images](https://github.com/wlisac/swift-on-balena) for Raspberry Pi are now available

A great [illustration](https://fbernutz.github.io/images/summaries-ios-interview-topics/swift-evolution.jpg) by [Feli](https://twitter.com/felibe444). Worth to check out her [sketches](https://fbernutz.github.io/sketchnotes/) from various conferences.

### Swift Forums

[Ethan Kusters](https://forums.swift.org/u/ethankusters) started [a discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/support-hosting-docc-archives-in-static-hosting-environments/53572) about support hosting DocC archives in static hosting environments.

> This post discusses an enhancement to Swift-DocC and Swift-DocC-Render that will allow developers to build DocC archives that can be hosted without custom routing. This is specifically designed to enable DocC to be used in additional static hosting environments, most notably GitHub Pages.
> 
> This change is meant as a quick solution to address a pressing need, and provides general goodness. But please know that we’ve heard the community’s feedback that they would love for Swift-DocC to directly emit static HTML, and this feature is high on the priority list.

[Sam Deane](https://twitter.com/samdeane) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/default-initable-protocol/53723) to implement a default initable protocol.

> I've come across factory-type situations where I've ended up making a protocol to represent that "this type can be constructed with a default init that takes no arguments".
>
> I've found myself wondering (a) whether this protocol already exists somewhere in the standard library, and (b) whether Swift could auto-conform any type to it if an init() exists for it.

[A good reminder](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-built-in-angle-type/53726) that a library [Swift Numerics](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics) does exist.
