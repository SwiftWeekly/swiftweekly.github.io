Quite a lot of work has been done to implement recently accepted Swift Evolution proposals, as well as improving their diagnostics and error messages. Interestingly, some of this work has been done by first-time contributors, which is amazing to see!

### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 9: [String Manifesto](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/67089)

This week JP Simard and Jesse Squires discuss the String Manifesto!

### Commits and pull requests

Slava Pestov [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9090) [SE-0156](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0156-subclass-existentials.md): *Class and Subtype existentials*

Brent Royal-Gordon [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9148) to improve diagnostics for multi-line string literals ([SE-0168](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0168-multi-line-string-literals.md)).

Brian King [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9098) [SE-0169](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0169-improve-interaction-between-private-declarations-and-extensions.md): *Improve Interaction Between `private` Declarations and Extensions*. 🚀

Robert Widmann has redone [exhaustiveness checking](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/8908), fixing a *lot* of SR-bugs in the process.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0170](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0170-nsnumber_bridge.md): *NSNumber bridging and Numeric types* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170424/036226.html) for Swift 4.

[SE-0173](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0173-swap-indices.md): *Add `MutableCollection.swapAt(_:_:)`* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170424/036229.html) with revisions and has also been implemented.

> The proposal is accepted, including the revision to change the method name from `swap(_:with:)` to `swapAt(_:_)` that came out of the Core Team meeting.
>
> The consensus on `swift-evolution` was to add the method, with division mostly on the naming of the method. The Core Team reviewed the proposed options as well as consulted [the API design guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) to resolve the issue.
>
> Two important points from the guidelines serve to us well here:
>
> "Omit all labels when arguments can’t be usefully distinguished”
>
> and:
>
> "When the first argument forms part of a prepositional phrase, give it an argument label... An exception arises when the first two arguments represent parts of a single abstraction. In such cases, begin the argument label after the preposition, to keep the abstraction clear."
>
> The combination of these rules leads to the method name `swapAt(_:_:)`, which the Core Team believes was most in line with the guidelines.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0174](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0174-filter-range-replaceable.md): *Change `filter` to return an associated type* by Ben Cohen is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000370.html).

> This proposal changes the `filter` operation on `Sequence` to return an associated type, and adds a default implementation to `RangeReplaceableCollection` to return the same type as the filtered collection.
>
> The recently accepted [SE-0165](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0165-dict.md) introduced a version of `filter` on `Dictionary` that returned a `Dictionary`. This had both performance and usability benefits: in most cases, a `Dictionary` is what the user wanted from the filter, and creating one directly from the filter operation is much more efficient than first creating an array then creating a `Dictionary` from it.
>
> However, this does result in some inconsistencies. Users may be surprised that this one specific collection returns `Self`, while other collections that would benefit from the same change still return `[Element]`. And some collections, such as `String`, might also benefit from usability and performance win similar to `Dictionary`. Additionally, these wins will be lost in generic code – if you pass a `Dictionary` into an algorithm that takes a `Sequence`, then when you filter it, you will still get an `Array`.
