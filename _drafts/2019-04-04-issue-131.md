### News and community

[Michael Ilseman](https://twitter.com/ilseman/) wrote [about `UTF-8` `String`](https://swift.org/blog/utf8-string/)
on the Swift.org blog.

> Swift 5 switches the preferred encoding of strings from `UTF-16` to `UTF-8`
> while preserving efficient Objective-C-interoperability. Because the `String`
> type abstracts away these low-level concerns, no source-code changes from
> developers should be necessary, but it’s worth highlighting some of the
> benefits this move gives us now and in the future.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0251](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0251-simd-additions.md): *SIMD additions* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0251-simd-additions/21957).

> A few teams within Apple have requested additions to the new SIMD types and
> protocols to better support their use cases. In addition, there are some
> features we punted out of the original review because we were up against a
> hard time deadline to which we would like to give further consideration.

### Swift Forums

[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter/) shares why the closure syntax uses [the `in` keyword](https://forums.swift.org/t/history-why-does-closure-syntax-use-the-keyword-in/21885/2).

> It's my fault, sorry. In the early days of Swift, we had a closure syntax
> that was very similar to traditional Javascript,
> `func (arg: Type, arg: Type) -> Return { ... }`. While this is nice and
> regular syntax, it is of course also very bulky and awkward if you're trying
> to support expressive functional APIs, such as `map`/`filter` on collections,
> or if you want libraries to be able to provide closure-based APIs that feel
> like extensions of the language.
>
> Our earliest adopters at Apple complained about this, and mandated that we
> support Ruby-style trailing closure syntax.
> This is tricky to fit into a C-style syntax like Swift's, and we tried many
> different iterations, including literally Ruby's `{|args| }` syntax, but many
> of them suffered from ambiguities or simply distaste and revolt from our
> early adopters. We wanted something that still looked like other parts of the
> language, but which could be parsed unambiguously and could span the breadth
> of use cases from a fully explicit function signature to extremely compact.
>
> We had already taken `in` as a keyword, we couldn't use `->` like Java does
> because it's already used to denote the return type, and we were concerned
> that using `=>` like C# would be too visually confusing. `in` made
> `xs.map { x in f(x) }` look vaguely like `for x in xs { f(x) }`, and people
> hated it less than the alternatives.

[Nate Chandler](https://twitter.com/neightchan) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-implicit-returns-from-single-expression-functions/21898) for implicit
returns from Single-Expression Functions.

> Swift provides a pleasant shorthand for short closures: if a closure contains
> just a single expression, that expression is implicitly returned — the
> `return` keyword can be omitted. We should provide this shorthand for
> functions as well.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79)
pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-property-delegates/21895)
to add Property Delegates.

> There are property implementation patterns that come up repeatedly. Rather
> than hardcode a fixed set of patterns into the compiler, we should provide a
> general "property delegate" mechanism to allow these patterns to be defined
> as libraries.
>
> This is an alternative approach to some of the problems intended to be
> addressed by the [2015-2016 property behaviors proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0030-property-behavior-decls.md).
> Some of the examples are the same, but this proposal is a completely
> different approach designed to be simpler, easier to understand for users,
> and less invasive in the compiler implementation. There is a section that
> discusses the substantive differences from that design at the end of this
> proposal.

[Brent Royal-Gordon](https://twitter.com/brentdax)
pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-static-and-class-subscripts/21850)
to allow `static` and `class` subscripts.

> We propose allowing `static subscript` and, in classes, `class subscript`
> declarations. These could be used through either `TypeName[index]` or
> `TypeName.self[index]` and would have all of the capabilities you would
> expect of a subscript. We also propose extending dynamic member lookup and
> key paths to static properties by using static subscripts.

[Michael Ilseman]() gave [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/string-consumption/21907)
on "`String` Consumption".

> **Collection consumers**
>
> Processing a string, or any `Collection` really, typically involves tracking
> and advancing a position (i.e. an `Index`). This makes something akin to
> `Slice` a great basis to add consuming operations, which advance indices from
> the front (or back if bidirectional).
>
> There are at least 3 ways to surface this:
>
> 1. A new wrapper type
> 2. Add these to `Slice`
> 3. Add these to all `Collection`s that are their own `SubSequence`
>
> Here's [an example](https://gist.github.com/milseman/f9b5528345db3a36bbdd138af52c5cda)
> of approach 3, which would put this functionality in a lot of namespaces
> (`Slice`, `Substring`, even `Data`). Having these broadly available could
> help discoverability, but we also don’t want to pollute namespaces. These are
> all "mutating" because they advance indices, but not because they modify the
> underlying collection. We need to see some usage to evaluate the tradeoffs.
>
> **Regex**
>
> I wrote more about regexes [here](https://gist.github.com/milseman/bb39ef7f170641ae52c13600a512782f#one-possible-approach)
> Regexes did not make it in Swift 5, but we should still pursue them.
