### Swift Unwrapped

[46: Restricting cross-module struct initializers](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/111543): Jesse and JP discuss the accepted [SE-0189](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0189-restrict-cross-module-struct-initializers.md) proposal, which makes structs less source-breaking.

### News and community

Paul Hudson [gives on overview](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/55/how-to-use-dynamic-member-lookup-in-swift) of what [SE-0195](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0195-dynamic-member-lookup.md): *Introduce User-defined "Dynamic Member Lookup" Types* brings to the table to make Swift more dynamic.

Keith Harrison [explains](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/replacing-flatmap-with-compactmap/) why one of `flatMap`'s implementations is now called `compactMap`, as per [SE-0187](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0187-introduce-filtermap.md): *Introduce `Sequence.compactMap(_:)`*.

### Commits and pull requests

Xiaodi Wu [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/14502) a pull request that improves the performance of floating-point constants after Jens Persson [discovered](http://forums.swift.org/t/is-floats-nextup-really-50-times-slower-than-necessary/9716) performance issues for `Float`s.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0195](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0195-dynamic-member-lookup.md): *Introduce User-defined "Dynamic Member Lookup" Types* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0195-introduce-user-defined-dynamic-member-lookup-types/8658/160).

> On February 8, 2018 the Core Team decided to accept this proposal.
>
> After reviewing the feedback from the community, the Core Team felt the spelling of the attribute should remain as proposed â€” `@dynamicMemberLookup`. The alternative of `@dynamic(...)` was also considered, but the Core Team felt that spelling to be too close to the dynamic keyword and a potential source of confusion.
>
> The rationale for the marker being an attribute instead of a protocol (as in the original proposal) was [well-articulated](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0195-introduce-user-defined-dynamic-member-lookup-types/8658/159) by Chris Lattner in the review thread in that the marker protocol would not provide the expected affordances of a normal protocol.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0199](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0199-bool-toggle.md): *Adding `toggle` to `Bool`* is [under review](http://forums.swift.org/t/se-0199-adding-toggle-method-to-bool/9841).

> For `Bool` variables, it is common to want to toggle the state of the variable. In larger (nested) structs, the duplication involved can become especially annoying:

{% highlight swift %} 
myVar.prop1.prop2.enabled = !myVar.prop1.prop2.enabled
{% endhighlight %}

> It's also easy to make a mistake in the code above if there are multiple `Bool` vars.
> [The proposed solution is to] add a method toggle on `Bool`:

{% highlight swift %} 
extension Bool {
    mutating func toggle() {
        self = !self
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

> This allows us to write the example above without duplication:

{% highlight swift %} 
myVar.prop1.prop2.enabled.toggle()
{% endhighlight %}

### Finally

The API does not work as expected? Can't be. It's unit tested and all. Did you [read its documentation](https://mobile.twitter.com/AirspeedSwift/status/962754808733036544)?
