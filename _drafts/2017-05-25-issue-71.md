Things have certainly been more quiet than usual as we approach [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc). Discussions on the [mailing lists](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170522/thread.html) (and even Twitter!) have been sparse. Only [two proposals](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) are awaiting or actively in review and it's unlikely we'll see any more proposals for Swift 4.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-4949](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4949): No error for using `as` patterns with CoreFoundation types
- [SR-4824](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4824): Add tests to check `Collection` constraints are being enforced
- [SR-4595](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4595): Tests generate lots of warnings

### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 12: [Swift Evolution](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/69638)

We debate if Swift evolution is pulling its weight, and if it's possible for Swift to remain "open" without the cost.

### News and community

Erica Sadun wrote about [5 Easy Dispatch Tricks](http://ericasadun.com/2017/05/23/5-easy-dispatch-tricks/) in Swift. There are some great tips here to improve your experience with Swift Dispatch.

David Owens released and is continuing development on a Swift implementation of the Language Server Protocol spec. Find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/owensd/swift-lsp).

### Commits and pull requests

George Karpenkov [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9450) support for the `-sanitize=fuzzer` flag. Similarly to Clang, the flag enables coverage instrumentation, and links `libLLVMFuzzer.a` to the produced binary. You can learn more about LLVM's libFuzzer on the [LLVM blog](http://blog.llvm.org/2015/04/fuzz-all-clangs.html) and at the [libFuzzer docs](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html). Pretty cool!

Itai Ferber [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9791) changes and enhancements to the new `Codable` APIs. This is part of the work for [SE-0166](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0166-swift-archival-serialization.md) and [SE-0167](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0167-swift-encoders.md).

Slava Pestov [fixed a bug](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9925) where `lazy` properties could become stored [and another](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9920) where they required an explicit `self`.

Dave Abrahams [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9924) substring comparison benchmarks.

Not new, but just recently merged, Johannes WeiÃŸ [added support](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/873) to statically build corelibs-foundation.

### Proposals

No updates on proposals this week! Check the [status page for details](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/).

### Mailing lists

It might be hard to believe but not much has happened on swift-evolution or the other lists this week. I'm starting to worry about what I'm going to write for next week's issue! ðŸ˜…

### Finally

And finally &mdash; WWDC is approaching. [Goats to stay calm](https://twitter.com/EverythingGoats/status/864679358123962368).
