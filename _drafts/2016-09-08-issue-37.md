### Proposals in review

Andrew Trick's proposal, [SE-0138](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0138-unsafebytes.md): *UnsafeBytes* is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-September/000273.html). This is a purely additive proposal to improve the Swift 3 migration experience.

> [SE-0107: UnsafeRawPointer](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0107-unsaferawpointer.md) formalized Swift's memory model with respect to strict aliasing and prevented arbitrary conversion between `UnsafePointer` types. When moving to Swift 3, users will need to migrate much of their code dealing with `UnsafePointer`s. The new `UnsafeRawPointer` makes that possible. It provides a legal means to operate on raw memory (independent of the type of values in memory), and it provides an API for binding memory to a type for subsequent normal typed access. However, migrating to these new APIs is not always straightforward. It has become customary to use `[UInt8]` in APIs that deal with a buffer of bytes and are agnostic to the type of values held by the buffer. However, converting between `UInt8` and the client's element type at every API transition is difficult to do safely. 

Joe Groff's proposal, [SE-0139](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0139-bridge-nsnumber-and-nsvalue.md): *Bridge Numeric Types to `NSNumber` and Cocoa Structs to `NSValue`*, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-September/000274.html).

> A handful of Swift numeric types are bridged to `NSNumber` when passed into Objective-C object contexts. We should extend this bridging behavior to all Swift numeric types. We should also bridge common Cocoa structs such as `NSRange` by boxing them into `NSValue` objects.
