### Proposals in review

[SE-0290](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0290-negative-availability.md): *Unavailability Condition* is [under a review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0290-unavailability-condition/41873).

> Swift historically supported the `#available` condition to check if a specific symbol **is** available for usage, but not the opposite. In this proposal, we'll present cases where checking for the **unavailability** of something is necessary, the ugly workaround needed to achieve it today and how a new `#unavailable` condition can fix it.

[SE-0291](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0291-package-collections.md): *Package Collections* is [under a review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0291-package-collections/41905).

> This is a proposal for adding support for Package Collections to SwiftPM. A package feed is a curated list of packages and associated metadata which makes it easier to discover an existing package for a particular use case. SwiftPM will allow users to subscribe to these collections, search them via the swift package-collections command-line interface, and will make their contents accessible to any clients of libSwiftPM. This proposal is focused on the shape of the command-line interface and the format of configuration data related to package collections.

### Swift Forums

[Nicole Jacque](https://twitter.com/racer_girl27) described [Swift 5.4 release process](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-5-4-release-process/41936).

> Downloadable snapshots of the Swift 5.4 release branch will be posted regularly as part of [continuous integration](https://ci.swift.org/) testing. As support is available, snapshot downloads will be added for newly supported platforms.
> 
> Once Swift 5.4 is released, the official final builds will also be posted in addition to the snapshots.
>
> On **Dec 14, 2020** the `release/5.4` branch will be cut in the swift repository and most related project repositories. This will contain the changes that will be released in Swift 5.4. After the branch is cut, changes can be landed on the branch via pull request if they meet the criteria for the release.

[Sam Lazarus](https://forums.swift.org/u/slazarus) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/proposal-static-member-lookup-on-protocol-metatypes/41946) that implements static member lookup on protocol metatypes.

> Using static member declarations to provide semantic names for commonly used values is an important tool in API design, reducing type repetition and improving call-site legibility. Currently, when a parameter is generic, there is no effective way to take advantage of these facilities. This proposal aims to relax restrictions on accessing static members via protocol metatypes to afford the same call-site legibility to generic APIs.

[Max Desiatov](https://twitter.com/MaxDesiatov) [informed](https://forums.swift.org/t/first-stable-release-of-swiftwasm-5-3-is-now-available/41868) that first stable release of [SwiftWasm 5.3](https://github.com/swiftwasm/swift/releases/tag/swift-wasm-5.3.0-RELEASE) is now available.

> You may have seen some posts about WebAssembly support in Swift on these forums previously. These were mostly questions and discussions about the toolchain development. Today I'm excited to make an announcement first and foremost for end users of Swift interested in applying it on more platforms.
>
> As a culmination of hard work from many people, the first stable release of SwiftWasm 5.3 is available. It allows you to compile your Swift code to [WebAssembly 28](https://webassembly.org/), and to interact with the host WebAssembly environment through [libraries that the SwiftWasm team maintains](https://github.com/swiftwasm/JavaScriptKit). WebAssembly is supported in all recently released major browsers, which means you can build browser apps written purely in Swift (although some JavaScript glue code invisible to users is required under the hood). Non-browser Wasm hosts are also supported, such as Node.js, [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/), or any other [WASI](https://wasi.dev/)-compatible hosts.

[Anders Bertelrud](https://forums.swift.org/u/abertelrud) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-ability-to-declare-executable-targets-in-swiftpm-manifests-to-support-main/41968) to add ability to declare executable targets in SwiftPM manifests.

> The Swift Package Manager doesnâ€™t currently provide a way for a package manifest to declare that a target is the main module of an executable. Instead, SwiftPM infers this by looking for a source file named  `main.swift`  (or  `main.c` ,  `main.cpp` , etc) in the source directory of the target.
> ...
> The most straightforward approach would be allow a target to be marked as executable in the manifest. This could take the form of either a parameter to the  `target`  type or a new target type. There is already an established pattern of using the type itself to denote the kind of target being declared (e.g.  `testTarget`  as a specialization of  `target` ), so the most natural approach seems to be to add a new  `executableTarget`  type for this purpose.
> 
> Using a separate target type in the manifest would also support any future differences between the parameters for an executable target and a library target.

[Dario Rexin](https://forums.swift.org/u/drexin) informed about static linking on Linux in Swift 5.3.1.

> I am happy to announce that with the release of Swift 5.3.1 statically linking the Swift `stdlib` components is now fully supported on Linux. This includes linking against Dispatch and the different Foundation components. Additionally building self-contained binaries is now possible by manually adding a few linker flags.
