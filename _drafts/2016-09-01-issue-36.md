### Proposals

Just like last week, there are no proposals active at this time.

Joe Groff did a write up of [two proposals](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/506) though, finishing the bridging of all Swift numeric types to `NSNumber` (and Cocoa structure to `NSValue`), as well as improved bridging of a Swift `Optional` to it's value (if present) or `NSNull` (if not).
