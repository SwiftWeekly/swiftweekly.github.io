    heading: Machine learning for voice made easy
    body: Why don‚Äôt more Swift apps use voice? Machine learning for voice is full of pitfalls, and the native platform solutions are both clunky and uncustomizable. So we open-sourced our modular library for iOS that integrates with Siri (along with libraries for Node, Python, Android, & React Native) and then built a no-code service for creating custom wake words, domain-specific speech recognition, and custom synthetic AI voices‚Äîwithout a steep learning curve.

[WWDC21](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/) is just a couple of days away! Everyone is super excited, and there will be many [community events](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/beyond-wwdc/) the whole week and even later this month. Don't worry if you can't follow everything. We have time! Most importantly is to enjoy this time of the year and follow along at your own pace!

This month is Pride Month, and for that reason, the new Pride in Swift [ommunity group](https://swift.org/diversity/#community-groups) is open.

I want to end this intro with [Apple‚Äôs WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apples-wwdc21-swift-student-challenge-winners-code-to-change-the-world/) winners article. This year they have featured three girls who's code can for sure change our world!

Now let's get to the news and enjoy the WWDC21! Thanks!

### News and community

[Holly Borla](https://twitter.com/hollyborla/) [posted](https://forums.swift.org/t/pride-in-swift-is-open/48837) that a new [Pride in Swift community group](	https://swift.org/diversity/#community-groups) is now open here on the Swift forums. As well she [updated](https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-the-swift-mentorship-program/48021/17) about Swift Mentorship Program.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0317](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0317-async-let.md): *Async Let* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0317-async-let/48848).

> Note that this feature builds upon the [structured concurrency proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0304-structured-concurrency.md), the [third review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0304-3rd-review-structured-concurrency/48847) of which is happening concurrently to better discuss common aspects such as naming.
>
> This review is part of the large [concurrency feature](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-concurrency-roadmap/41611), which we are reviewing in several parts. While we've tried to make it independent of other concurrency proposals that have not yet been reviewed, it may have some dependencies that we've failed to eliminate. Please do your best to review it on its merits, while still understanding its relationship to the larger feature. You may also want to raise interactions with previous already-accepted proposals ‚Äì that might lead to opening up a separate thread of further discussion to keep the review focused.

[SE-0304](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0317-async-let.md): *Structured Concurrency* is [under the third review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0304-3rd-review-structured-concurrency/48847).

> Following on from the [second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0304-2nd-review-structured-concurrency/47217), the proposal authors have made several changes. The changes made after the second review can be found at the [end of the proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0304-structured-concurrency.md#review-changes), and the full diff can be found [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/01bdbdc2be26f9f26e4fad97e89d6648be1a6917#diff-6e3f26a7c1e2c41a13bcf34ef4c7d84625339b2898702f5e0bed0d6e05f1a778).

[SE-0292](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0316-global-actors.md): *Package Registry Service* is [under third review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0292-3rd-review-package-registry-service/49107).

> The proposal has been [amended](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/1319) to address the feedback from the [second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0292-2nd-review-package-registry-service), and is ready for another review.

[SE-0311](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0311-task-locals.md): *Task-local values* is [under third review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0311-3rd-review-task-local-values/49122).

> The second review of SE-0311 was run to consider a significantly different language approach for binding and accessing task-local values, one based around property wrappers rather than an explicit key type. Shortly after the second review started, the community provided strong feedback that the proposal's new use of property wrappers didn't match their expectations because of the indirection through a wrapper value. The author agreed to re-revise the proposal, and the review was extended.

### Swift Forums

Swift on the Server Workgroup [Annual Update 2020](https://forums.swift.org/t/sswg-annual-update-2020/49223).

[Alejandro Martinez](https://twitter.com/alexito4) [shared](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-concurrency-video-series/48872) he's video series about Swift Concurrency.

[Jonathan Grynspan](https://twitter.com/grynspan) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-temporary-uninitialized-buffers/48954) to add temporary uninitialised buffers.

> I'd like to propose a new inlinable function in the standard library that allocates a buffer of a specified type and capacity, provides that buffer to a closure, and then deallocates the buffer. The buffer would be passed to the closure in an uninitialised state and treated as uninitialised on closure return‚Äîthat is, the closure would be responsible for initialising and deinitialising the elements in the buffer.

[Alexis Schultz](https://forums.swift.org/u/alexisqapa) explained [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/idea-switch-without-subject/49075) about `switch` without subject.
