    heading: Machine learning for voice made easy
    body: Why don‚Äôt more Swift apps use voice? We tried‚Äîmachine learning for voice is full of pitfalls, and Apple‚Äôs solution is both clunky and not customizable. So we open-sourced our modular voice library for iOS that integrates with Siri (along with libraries for Node, Python, Android, & React Native) and then built a no-code service for creating custom voice AI. We‚Äôre calling it Spokestack Maker. Maker empowers Swift programmers to customize the fundamentals of voice technology‚Äîmake their own wake words, domain-specific speech recognition, and custom synthetic AI voices‚Äîwithout a steep learning curve using no-code tools. Spokestack Maker turns voice just another interface Swift developers utilize‚Äîlike a mouse & keyboard, or a touchscreen‚Äîto interact with users. Speak up and start your free trial.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0317](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0317-async-let.md): *Async Let* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0317-async-let/48848).

> Note that this feature builds upon the [structured concurrency proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0304-structured-concurrency.md), the [third review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0304-3rd-review-structured-concurrency/48847) of which is happening concurrently in order to better discuss common aspects such as naming.

While we've tried to make it independent of other concurrency proposals that have not yet been reviewed, it may have some dependencies that we've failed to eliminate. Please do your best to review it on its own merits, while still understanding its relationship to the larger feature. You may also want to raise interactions with previous already-accepted proposals ‚Äì that might lead to opening up a separate thread of further discussion to keep the review focused.

[SE-0304](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0317-async-let.md): *Structured Concurrency* is [under the third review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0304-3rd-review-structured-concurrency/48847).

> Following on from the [second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0304-2nd-review-structured-concurrency/47217), the proposal authors have made a number of changes.

### Swift Forums

[Alejandro Martinez](https://twitter.com/alexito4) [shared](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-concurrency-video-series/48872) he's video series about Swift Concurrency.

[Jonathan Grynspan](https://twitter.com/grynspan) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-temporary-uninitialized-buffers/48954) to add temporary uninitialized buffers.

> I'd like to propose a new inlinable function in the standard library that allocates a buffer of a specified type and capacity, provides that buffer to a closure, and then deallocates the buffer. The buffer would be passed to the closure in an uninitialized state and treated as uninitialized on closure return‚Äîthat is, the closure would be responsible for initializing and deinitializing the elements in the buffer.

[Alexis Schultz](https://forums.swift.org/u/alexisqapa) explained [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/idea-switch-without-subject/49075) about `switch` without subject.
