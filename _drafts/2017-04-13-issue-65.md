### Accepted proposals

[SE-0160](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0160-objc-inference.md): *Limiting `@objc` inference* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000349.html).

> The feedback on the second round of review was very light and uniformly positive.
>
> The proposal has been implemented in https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/8379. Early experience migrating a nontrivial Cocoa app (~200kloc, roughly half Swift and half Objective-C) resulted in a 5.7% decrease in code size (Release build) and required only 40 new @objc annotations, 37 of which were indicated by the new compiler warnings, 2 of which manifested as post-migration errors, and the last of which was found with the new (opt-in) runtime warnings.
>
> Thank you to Doug Gregor for the proposal, and also the implementation of this improvement!

### Proposals in review

[SE-0166](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0166-swift-archival-serialization.md): *Swift Archival & Serialization* by Itai Ferber, Michael LeHew, and Tony Parker is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000346.html).

> Foundation's current archival and serialization APIs (`NSCoding`, `NSJSONSerialization`, `NSPropertyListSerialization`, etc.), while fitting for the dynamism of Objective-C, do not always map optimally into Swift. This document lays out the design of an updated API that improves the developer experience of performing archival and serialization in Swift.
>
> Specifically:
>
> * It aims to provide a solution for the archival of Swift `struct` and `enum` types
> * It aims to provide a more type-safe solution for serializing to external formats, such as JSON and plist
>
> The primary motivation for this proposal is the inclusion of native Swift `enum` and `struct` types in archival and serialization.

[SE-0167](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0167-swift-encoders.md): *Swift Encoders* by Itai Ferber, Michael LeHew, and Tony Parker is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000345.html).

> As part of the proposal for a Swift archival and serialization API ([SE-0166](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0166-swift-archival-serialization.md)), we are also proposing new API for specific new encoders and decoders, as well as introducing support for new `Codable` types in `NSKeyedArchiver` and `NSKeyedUnarchiver`.
>
> This proposal composes the latter two stages laid out in [SE-0166](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0166-swift-archival-serialization.md).
>
> With the base API discussed in [SE-0166](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0166-swift-archival-serialization.md), we want to provide new encoders for consumers of this API, as well as provide a consistent story for bridging this new API with our existing `NSCoding` implementations. We would like to offer a base level of support that users can depend on, and set a pattern that third parties can follow in implementing and extending their own encoders.

[SE-0168](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0168-multi-line-string-literals.md): *Multi-Line String Literals* by John Holdsworth, Brent Royal-Gordon, and Tyler Cloutier is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000347.html).

> This proposal introduces multi-line string literals to Swift source code. This has been discussed a few times on swift-evolution most recently putting forward a number of different syntaxes that could achieve this goal each of which has their own use case and constituency for discussion.
>
> Multi-line String literals are a common programming-language feature that is, to date, still missing in Swift. Whether generating XML/JSON messages or building usage messages in Swift scripts, providing string literals that extend over multiple lines offers a simple way to represent text without having to manually break lines using string concatenation. Concatenation is ungainly and may result in slow compilation.

[SE-0169](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0169-improve-interaction-between-private-declarations-and-extensions.md): *Improve Interaction Between `private` Declarations and Extensions* by David Hart and Chris Lattner is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000348.html).

> In Swift 3, a declaration marked `private` may be accessed by anything nested in the scope of the private declaration, for example a private property or method defined on a struct may be accessed by methods defined within that struct.
>
> This model was introduced by [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md) and with nearly a year of experience using this model, it has worked well in almost all cases. The primary case it falls down is when the implementation of a type is split into a base definition and a set of extensions. Because of the [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md) model, extensions to the type are not allowed to access private members defined on that type.
>
> This proposal recommends extending `private` access control so that members defined in an extension of a type have the same access as members defined on the type itself, so long as the type and extension are in the same source file. We expect this to dramatically reduce the number of uses of `fileprivate` in practice.
