### Podcasts

In [episode 83 of Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/314852),
Jesse and JP talk about Modify Accessors.

In [Swift by Sundell #63](https://swiftbysundell.com/podcast/61/), [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) and [Donny Wals](https://twitter.com/DonnyWals) and [Antoine van der Lee](https://twitter.com/twannl) how has Swift changed in 2019, and where might things be headed in 2020.

### News and community

[John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) shared a great article about [the decade of Swift](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/the-decade-of-swift) and [announced](https://twitter.com/johnsundell/status/1211743896591568899) a static site generator built specifically for Swift developers called [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish).

Sad news that Vapor Cloud will be shutting down on February 29th, but there are many good [alternatives](https://twitter.com/leogdion/status/1214179319318220802).

[Joe Duffy](https://www.twitter.com/Joe_Duffy) wrote a [blog post](https://josephduffy.co.uk/partial-in-swift) about tool [Partial](https://github.com/JosephDuffy/Partial) - type-safe wrapper that mirrors the properties of the wrapped type but makes each property optional.

[Steven Prichard](https://github.com/spprichard) explained he's personal experience with [Open API Tools & Swift](https://forums.swift.org/t/open-api-tools-swift-personal-experience/31962).

> I recently began a personal project in which I wanted to use Kubernetes (K8s) & Swift. To get started I created a library that was going to house all the K8s types, and the HTTP Client for communicating with the K8s API. With the goal of importing this library into all the other projects I had planned. Lucky enough for me, K8s uses the OpenAPI Spec, so generating the client code should be easy. I was mistaken, for Swift that is not the case. Specifically for any Swift client that you wanted to run on Linux. At the time of writing this, there did not exist a Swift Client that the Open-API code generation tool could generate that could be ran on Linux. I had concluded, with the help of others, that if I wanted a Pure-Swift Kubernetes library that could be ran on Linux I would have to write the HTTP Client code myself.

[Gor Gyolchanyan](https://twitter.com/_technogen_) pitched idea about [passing custom getter and setter to property wrapper initializer](https://forums.swift.org/t/passing-custom-getter-and-setter-to-property-wrapper-initializer/32000).

> A lot of use cases for property wrappers (like SwiftUI's `@Binding` or a simple `@Lazy`) rely on custom accessor closures of the form `() -> WrappedValue` and `(WrappedValue) -> Void` for the getter and the setter respectively. To that end, I'd like to suggest an improvement to the property wrapper mechanism to help improve the readability of such use cases.

[Sergej Jaskiewicz](https://twitter.com/broadway_lamb) shared a proposal to [handle future cases of enums in libraries without binary stability concerns](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-handling-future-cases-of-enums-in-libraries-without-binary-stability-concerns/32026).

> [SE-0192](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0192-non-exhaustive-enums.md) introduced a mechanism to add new cases to enums defined in the standard library and overlays in a source-compatible way. [SE-0260](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0260-library-evolution.md) later lifted this restriction, allowing to use this mechanism in all libraries built in library evolution mode.
> 
> We propose to remove this restriction completely by:
> 
> * allowing all library authors to mark their public enums as @frozen;
> * warning the clients that exhaustively switch over a non-frozen enum declared in another module, * suggesting them to add an @unknown default case.


[Steve K. Chiu](https://forums.swift.org/u/steve_k_chiu) [pitched](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-property-as-fallback-shortcut-to-self-property/32060) how to make `self.property` more readable at the point of use.

> The motivation is pretty much the same as [SE-0009](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0009-require-self-for-accessing-instance-members.md)
> 
> That is, we need a shorter form of self.property that is more readable at the point of use.
> 
> The idea is:
> 
> Add fallback lookup for identifier starts with single `_` (ex. _name), if the identifier is not a local variable , member property or global variable, then treat it as self.(identifier without `_`) (ex. self.name)


[Alfredo Delli Bovi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfredodellibovi) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pre-pitch-whitespaces-and-punctuation-for-methods-declarations/32073) that would allow more characters (like whitespaces and punctuations) for escaped identifiers.

> When declaring testing methods, unfortunately, it may results in descriptive methods that are hard to read because of its lack of whitespace and punctuations.
> 
> I would like to pitch a proposal that adds support for a more natural language by allowing whitespaces and punctuation to methods declaration with a back-ticked syntax. As a usage example it would be something like:
> 
> `func test object returns true when validation succeed ()`
> 
> Instead of a less readable camel case equivalent:
> 
> `func testObjectReturnsTrueWhenValidationSucceed()`
