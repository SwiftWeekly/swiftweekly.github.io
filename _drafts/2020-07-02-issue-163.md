    body: LINE is the leading mobile messaging platform in Japan and boasts one of the largest Swift codebases in Asia. In addition to supporting Swift versions from day 1, we strongly value semantics, protocols, and strongly typed systems. Many of our members are also active in the OSS community and support both local and global meetups and peer labs. Come join us and see what Swift can do in the real world.

### Podcasts

In the latest episode of Swift Unwrapped, [Jesse](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires) and [JP](https://twitter.com/simjp) talk [about](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/fxMk4ipF) tuples.

In [episode 75](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/75/) of the Swift by Sundell podcast, [Dave Verwer](https://twitter.com/daveverwer) and [Sven A. Schmidt](https://twitter.com/_sa_s) join [John](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) to talk about their newly launched [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/), and what the overall state of Swift’s package ecosystem currently is. Also, dependency management, composing libraries, deploying server-side Swift in production, and much more.

### News and community

In this year's WWDC 2020 Apple had two main sections of videos about Swift language and relevant topics:

* [Swift in Xcode 12](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=4nh602ih)
* [Swift deep dive](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=tjv7v7k1)

Addition to that [Tom Doron](https://twitter.com/tomerdoron) [presented](https://t.co/EjxMrRoGLj?amp=1) how to use Swift on AWS Lambda with Xcode.

[Amy Tsai](https://twitter.com/mousiechika) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/mousiechika/status/1275547535206166531) sketch awesome session notes for [Whats New In Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10170/) session.

Great project by [Federico Zanatello](https://twitter.com/zntfdr) [WWDC Notes](https://www.wwdcnotes.com/) - The TL;DW for Apple's WWDC videos. You can read session notes written by the community.

Apple released Xcode 12 and here are [release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-12-beta-release-notes#Swift) what has changed in Swift counterpart.

Cory Benfield [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Lukasaoz/status/1275167892510826502) that Swift Crypto 1.1.0 RC1 is [available](https://github.com/apple/swift-crypto/releases/tag/1.1.0-rc.1). It brings the new CryptoKit APIs from Apple’s WWDC20 platforms to all other Swift platforms.

The first release candidate of Swift fore [TensorFlow v.0.10.0 is out](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md#release-candidates), get it here. Friends from Swift for TensorFlow has a [great weekly newsletter](https://www.s4tfnews.com/).

[Bruno Rocha](https://twitter.com/rockthebruno) wrote [a blog post](https://swiftrocks.com/benefits-of-throwing-functions-try-swift-underrated-feature) about benefits of using throwing functions (try) - Swift's most underrated feature?.

### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/32488) bug in generic signature minimization. It [turned out](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/1274914547728515072) that the fix doesn't require a big redesign of the `GenericSignatureBuilder` after all. It's just a five line addition of a new `'if'` statement.

### Swift Forums

[Erica Sadun](https://twitter.com/ericasadun) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/returning-to-an-old-hobbyhorse-migrating-higher-order-function-names-to-comply-with-api-guidelines/37728) to migrate higher order function names to comply with API guidelines.

> Swift's higher order functions mostly predate the API guidelines and are based on terms of art. The community debated about this in the past and the "Term of Art" hammer won at that time. Perhaps we can reconsider now that Swift is entering its comfortable middle age reflective period as a missed opportunity.
>
> It would be simple to alias map, filter, etc with API compliant names (mapped, mapping, filtered, filtering), slow-walk-deprecate the former with the gentlest touch, and move towards a more consistent dev-facing vocabulary by replacing the terms in the SPL docs and devdoc tutorials (with footnotes or sidebars) to establish a new standard long before removing the old.
>
> Breaking changes have a high bar so it would take such a slow and cautious approach to migrate the community towards these changes. Backwards compatibility would need to be maintained for a longer period of time than usual. I'm curious as to what people think.

[Erica Sadun](https://twitter.com/ericasadun) explained [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/extend-swiftpm-packagedescription-to-introduce-metadata/37722) to extend SwiftPM `PackageDescription` to introduce metadata.

> A Swift Package defines the sources and dependencies for successful compilation. The [PackageDescription](https://docs.swift.org/package-manager/) specifies items like the supported Swift version, linker settings, and so forth.
> 
> What it does not do is offer metadata. You won’t find email for the active project manager, a list of major authors, descriptive tags, an abstract or discussion of the package, a link to documentation, deprecation information or links to superceding packages upon deprecation.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) starthed [a conversation](https://forums.swift.org/t/revisiting-the-source-compatibility-impact-of-se-0274-concise-magic-file-names/37720) about revisiting the source compatibility impact of [SE-0274](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0274-magic-file.md): Concise magic file names.

> In light of the discussion of [principles for (trailing closure) evolution proposals](https://forums.swift.org/t/principles-for-trailing-closure-evolution-proposals/37265) and based on feedback we've received from the [Swift 5.3 development snapshots](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots), I'd like to revisit [SE-0274: Concise magic file names](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0274-magic-file.md). In particular, I feel like SE-0247 has violated the "Source Compatibility" principle more than is necessary, and that we should consider revising the proposal.
> 
> SE-0247 includes an additive change (`#filePath` literal to provide the full path to the file), but then introduces three changes that affect existing sources:
> 
1. `#file` literals have a different form that does not include the full path name. Therefore, the spelling `#file` has changed meaning.
2. The compiler provides a warning when a wrapper around a `#filePath` -defaulting function passes it `#file` instead, or vice versa.
3. Standard library functions like `precondition` currently use `#file`, and therefore have had their behavior changed to no longer produce the full path name by default.

[Tom Doron](https://forums.swift.org/u/tomerd) shared [meeting notes](https://forums.swift.org/t/june-10th-2020/37863) for the Swift on the Server Workgroup June 10th, 2020 meeting.

[Frederick Kellison-Linn](https://twitter.com/jumhyn) shared [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/compound-variable-names/37963) that introduces a syntax for defining function-typed variables which have compound names.

> This proposal introduces a syntax for defining funciton-typed variables which have compound names (i.e., names with argument labels). This allows the call sites of such variables to achieve the same clarity that is achieveable with func declarations.
