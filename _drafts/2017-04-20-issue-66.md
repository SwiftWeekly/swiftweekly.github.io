### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 7: [Access Control - The Saga Continues](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/65851)

In this week’s episode of _Swift Unwrapped_, your hosts Messrs. Simard and Squires discuss the rollercoaster that is the evolution of access control in Swift: where have we come from, where are we now, and where are we headed in the future? Tune in and become enlightened. 💡

### News and community

There’s already a new point release for [Brisk](https://github.com/br1sk/brisk), the delightful macOS app for submitting radars by [Keith Smiley](https://twitter.com/SmileyKeith).

And if you love radars so much, maybe you’re one of the chosen ones selected to try the shiny new [Bug Reporter beta](https://twitter.com/an0/status/854066062605897728)? It’s great to see Apple improving its communication channel for developers!


### Access Control Pitches

Although I had hoped this section could lead to a separate _Swift Access Control Discussion_ newsletter, it looks like that’s not in the cards:

> The core team considers the access-control matter closed for Swift 4 and will not be reviewing any further proposals in this area.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0161](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0161-key-paths.md): *Smart KeyPaths: Better Key-Value Coding for Swift* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000356.html).

The meat of this proposal is elevating key paths from plain old strings created safely with `#keyPath` to a full type. Aside from the path itself, it could also hold things like "type, mutability, property name(s), and ability to set/get values."

This proposal went through a syntax revision to change `#keyPath` to the lighter weight backslash `\`, like you’re "escaping" the reference to a property rather than accessing the property directly.

> The [first review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000342.html) established the main substance of the proposal, while the second review focused mostly on the more lightweight `\` syntax.
>
> The core team felt that the leading `\` is our best option for introducing keypaths. It is lightweight, yet provides a visual "escape" to indicate that the evaluation of the entities being referenced is being delayed. As noted in the result of the [first review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000342.html), this is part of a longer-term plan to use the `\` for unapplied method references, bringing the two closely-related features into syntactic alignment over time and providing an opportunity to stage in the important but currently-source-breaking changes accepted in [SE-0042](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0042-flatten-method-types.md).

[SE-0164](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0164-remove-final-support-in-protocol-extensions.md): *Remove final support in protocol extensions* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000355.html).

I often struggle to explain functions in protocol extensions to Swift newcomers: is it like a superclass implementation? Do you "override" them? How does dispatch work compared to methods defined directly within a type? This proposal removes one confusing bit and disallows the `final` keyword for functions in protocol extensions.

> In the current version of Swift, the final keyword does not modify dispatch behavior in any way, and it does not generate an error message. This keyword has no use in Swift's current protocol model. Functions in protocol extensions cannot be overridden and will always use direct dispatch.

[SE-0169](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0169-improve-interaction-between-private-declarations-and-extensions.md): *Improve Interaction Between `private` Declarations and Extensions* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000357.html).

Using the `private` keyword will now have a slightly wider scope: extensions to a type within the same file can now access private members.

> The core team feels that this proposal makes private access align more closely with the goals of the language:
> * It supports the notion that extensions are a code-organization tool: one should be able to break up a type’s definition into several extensions to improve the clarity of that code, without having to open up access or otherwise view the members in different extensions as completely-distinct entities. The core team expects future language evolution to reinforce the notion that extensions are more of a code organization tool than distinct entities, e.g., allowing stored properties to be introduced in an extension.
> * It makes private more usable as the default sub-internal access level, which supports progressive disclosure of the access control system and better matches with programmer’s expectations about what private access means.
> * It makes fileprivate more meaningful, because it is only needed for those cases where one is reaching across types (or among types and globals) within a file. It will also become more rare, which matches well with its longer, descriptive name.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0170](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0170-nsnumber_bridge.md): *NSNumber bridging and Numeric types* by Philippe Hausler is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000351.html).

`NSNumber` is a very un-Swifty type: it rolls in all kinds of integer and floating point types into one big type. This proposal suggests ways to clean up the `NSNumber` bridging and handle underflow and overflow gracefully.

> `NSNumber` has been a strange duck in the Swift world especially when it has come to bridging and interacting with other protocols...`as?` for NSNumber should mean "Can I safely express the value stored in this opaque box called a `NSNumber` as the value I want?".

[SE-0171](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0171-reduce-with-inout.md): *Reduce with `inout`* by Chris Eidhof is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000352.html).

The `reduce` method passes along partial results to the next iteration, making copies each time. This proposal suggests adding a "reduce into" variant that uses an `inout` parameter instead to be more efficient in some cases:

> A new variant of `reduce` should be added to the standard library. Instead of taking a `combine` function that is of type `(A, Iterator.Element) -> A`, the full type and implementation of the added `reduce` will be:

{% highlight swift %}
extension Sequence {
    func reduce<A>(into initial: A, _ combine: (inout A, Iterator.Element) -> ()) -> A {
        var result = initial
        for element in self {
            combine(&result, element)
        }
        return result
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

[SE-0172](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0172-one-sided-ranges.md): *One-sided Ranges* by Ben Cohen, Dave Abrahams, & Brent Royal-Gordon is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000358.html).

> This proposal introduces the concept of a "one-sided" range, created via prefix/postfix versions of the existing range operators.
>
> It also introduces a new protocol, `RangeExpression`, to simplify the creation of methods that take different kinds of ranges.
>
> [..]
>
> [The proposed solution is to] introduce a one-sided range syntax, where the "missing" side is inferred to be the start/end:

{% highlight swift %}
// half-open right-handed range
let greeting = s[..<i]
// closed right-handed range
let withComma = s[...i]
// left-handed range (no need for half-open variant)
let location = s[i...]
{% endhighlight %}

### Mailing lists

Since the mailing lists include folks from many countries and experience levels, it’s important to be precise on what you mean. Here’s a communications pro-tip from core team member Dave Abrahams:

> [P]lease don't use the word “safe” this way around here as it
conflicts with the definition used by Swift. As defined by Swift, safety has nothing to do with whether something might trap or whether it's spelled with a "!", but about whether it can corrupt memory ([source](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170410/035791.html))
