### Swift Unwrapped

In [episode 28 of Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/85798), JP and Jesse discuss the Clang refactoring engine and how you shouldn’t be afraid of C++ code.


### News and community

The 11th annual US LLVM Developers’ Meeting is coming up on October 18, and the [list of accepted talks](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2017-10/) is available. Something to look forward to if you’re interested in the compiler level or curious about [implementing Swift generics](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2017-10/#talk15)?

[Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache) published [The Swift Compiler's Build System](https://modocache.io/the-swift-compilers-build-system), the second post in his ongoing series [Getting Started with Swift Compiler Development](http://modocache.io/getting-started-with-swift-development).
