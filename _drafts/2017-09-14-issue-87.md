It was iPhone hardware day this week, but don‚Äôt forget about the software side of things ‚Äî¬†[iOS 11, Xcode 9, and Swift 4 GM releases](https://developer.apple.com/download/) all available on the developer portal.

But you‚Äôve decided to stop refreshing the Apple Store web site and have found your way here...welcome! Let‚Äôs get into the Swift news.

### Starter tasks

Starter tasks are a great way to get started with contributing to Swift. Ask questions right in the bug reporting system, and get feedback when you submit your pull request.

* [SR-5856](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5856): Error claims a protocol is a generic type, but no generics are used
* [SR-5457](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5457): Specific error message when user tries to compile Swift executable
* [SR-5337](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5337): Improve diagnostic for 'var' in parameter position

### Swift Unwrapped

In [episode 28 of Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/85798), JP and Jesse discuss the Clang & Swift refactoring engines and how you shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of C++ code.


### News and community

Xcode 9 is out, with both Swift 3.2 and Swift 4.0 support! üéâ Check out the _Swift Language_ section of the Xcode 9 GM release notes while you‚Äôre waiting for your [download](https://developer.apple.com/download/) to complete.

The 11th annual US LLVM Developers‚Äô Meeting is coming up on October 18, and the [list of accepted talks](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2017-10/) is available. Something to look forward to if you‚Äôre interested in the compiler level or curious about [implementing Swift generics](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2017-10/#talk15)?

[Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache) published [The Swift Compiler's Build System](https://modocache.io/the-swift-compilers-build-system), the second post in his ongoing series [Getting Started with Swift Compiler Development](http://modocache.io/getting-started-with-swift-development).


### Commits and pull requests

Here‚Äôs one from the archives: you may know that an optional is an `enum` behind the scenes, but did you know optionals used to be arrays that were either empty or holding a single element? Take a trip in the wayback machine: here‚Äôs [the commit from 2013](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/9e0ecddfb9e0aacab537ff2a4299b5f209e845d9#diff-a9c187958304db124979ee946128cfa5R72) and associated [Twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/907342743499714560).

[Michael Ilseman](https://github.com/milseman) landed a cherry pick to fix mutating the various `String` views with `popFirst` in Swift 3.2. This is a great example of [a small targeted fix with unit tests](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11806/files), and as someone who enjoys reading code I think it‚Äôs a great example of working on the standard library.

[Max Moiseev](https://github.com/moiseev) landed an interesting change to the `BinaryInteger` protocol [to speed up performance of accessing arbitrary words within an integer](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11731). It‚Äôs great to see the attention to detail the Swift team spends looking at performance. üôè

[Doug Gregor](https://github.com/DougGregor) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11899) to implement more of [SE-0157](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0157-recursive-protocol-constraints.md): _Support recursive constraints on associated types_. The bug report [SR-3453](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3453) has all the details and links to the previous pull requests on this feature.


### Swift Evolution Proposals

The review period for [SE-0184]((https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0184-unsafe-pointers-add-missing.md)): _Unsafe[Mutable][Raw][Buffer]Pointer]_ is over, and we‚Äôre still waiting for the official results.

You can review the status of all proposals on [the Swift Evolution status page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/).


### Mailing lists

As part of his research, [Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache) asked about the history of the Swift project‚Äôs build system. Check out his [original post with timeline](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170904/005296.html) and the ensuing thread for all the details.

Alejandro Alonso opened up discussion on [unifying the concept of random number generation in Swift](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170904/039605.html). In addition to the original post and thread, there‚Äôs a gist with some ideas on what [the end API might look like](https://gist.github.com/Azoy/5d294148c8b97d20b96ee64f434bb4f5).

Logan Shire posted about [some common issues when working with enumerations](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170904/039598.html): needing to iterate through all options, and getting a count of cases. Follow the rest of the thread for some discussion on [why you might need these features](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170904/039601.html) and how they might be implemented.

Get a real life behind-the-scenes peek at Swift engineers discussing [coroutines, ABI stability, and stack vs heap](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170911/005321.html) over two hours.


### Finally

Q: What color would Chris Lattner paint the [bikeshed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding)? üé®

A: [Resilience](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170904/039672.html).
