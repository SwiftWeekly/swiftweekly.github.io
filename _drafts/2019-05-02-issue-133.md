### Podcasts

On the Swift by Sundell podcast, [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) and [Michael Ilseman](https://twitter.com/ilseman/) discuss [String, its implementation, and its related APIs](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/46).

On the Swift Community Podcast, [Matt Dias](https://twitter.com/mdiasdev), [Barbie Vanaiki](https://twitter.com/barbieinbeta), [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell), and I discuss [the state of the Swift community](https://www.swiftcommunitypodcast.org/episodes/4).

### Commits and pull requests

[Thomas Roughton](https://twitter.com/_torust) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24198) introducing `String` to `Float` performance improvements and benchmarks.

[Michael Gottesman](https://twitter.com/gottesmang) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/24314) introducing stronger compile-time checking of ownership in the Swift Intermediate Language (SIL), also allowing an improved Auto Reference Counting (ARC) optimizer.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0255](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0255-omit-return.md): *Implicit returns from single-expression functions* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0255-implicit-returns-from-single-expression-functions/23581/2).

> The review demonstrated clear support for this syntax for property and subscript getters, where the need to return simple single expressions is common.
>
> On eliding the `return` from functions, the review feedback was more divided. While there was support from some reviewers, others expressed the view that the feature should be restricted to just getters. However, on reviewing the feedback, the core team does not see a strong case was made against applying it to functions as well, when weighed against the benefits of a single uniform rule.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0259](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0259-approximately-equal.md): *Approximate Equality for Floating Point* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0259-approximate-equality-for-floating-point/23627).

> The internet is full advice about what not to do when comparing floating-point values:
>
> - "Never compare floats for equality."
> - "Always use an epsilon."
> - "Floating-point values are always inexact."
>
> Much of this advice is false, and most of the rest is technically correct but misleading.
> Almost none of it provides specific and correct recommendations for what you *should*
> do if you need to compare floating-point numbers.
>
> There is no uniformly correct notion of "approximate equality", and there is no uniformly
> correct tolerance that can be applied without careful analysis, but we can define
> approximate equality functions that are better than what most people will come up with
> without assistance from the standard library.

### Swift Forums

[Alexander Momchilov](https://forums.swift.org/u/alexanderm/summary) shared [an overview of the state of data structures](https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-more-data-structures-to-the-standard-library/23651) in Swift.

> We have just `Set` (unordered), `Dictionary` (unordered), and `Array`. No concurrent collections (value types solves most of the issues here, but it doesn't solve things like the classic produce-consumer, for example), no linked lists, queues, stacks, bimaps, multimaps, or sort ordered collections.

Be sure to read [the thread](https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-more-data-structures-to-the-standard-library/23651) for some insightful discussion on the topic.

[Michael Ilseman](https://twitter.com/Ilseman) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-offsetting-indices-and-relative-ranges/23837) for convenience syntax applying an integer offset to an existing index.

> Applying offsets to indices and using relative ranges brings ease of use improvements to all Collections and is a convenient tools for reducing bugs in `Int`-indexed Collections. It also makes types like String more approachable in casual contexts, such as for programming puzzles and learning.
