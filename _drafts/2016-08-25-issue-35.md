### Starter tasks

{% include task_remind.html %}

### Repositories

A number of new repositories have shown up under the [Apple GitHub organization](https://github.com/apple). Most relevant to this community would be the new [Xcode playground support](https://github.com/apple/swift-xcode-playground-support) project &mdash; *Logging and communication to allow Swift toolchains to communicate with Xcode.*

The other new repositories are all related to the [Calendar and Contacts Server](https://www.calendarserver.org) project, which is a standards-compliant server implementing the CalDAV and CardDAV protocols. The project is accompanied by a number of sub-projects, all prefixed with "ccs".

This project isn't particularly relevant to the Swift community, although it is interesting to see more open source projects from Apple being hosted on GitHub. It was originally [released in 2006 at WWDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_and_Contacts_Server), but I'm not sure if it had been open source before this week or not (perhaps on [opensource.apple.com](https://opensource.apple.com)).

Calendar and Contacts Server repositories:

- [ccs-calendarserver](https://github.com/apple/ccs-calendarserver)
- [ccs-twistedextensions](https://github.com/apple/ccs-twistedextensions)
- [ccs-pysecuretransport](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pysecuretransport)
- [ccs-pyosxframeworks](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pyosxframeworks)
- [ccs-pycalendar](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pycalendar)
- [ccs-caldavtester](https://github.com/apple/ccs-caldavtester)
- [ccs-pykerberos](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pykerberos)
- [ccs-caldavclientlibrary](https://github.com/apple/ccs-caldavclientlibrary)
- [ccs-pyopendirectory](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pyopendirectory)

### Mailing lists

Daniel Dunbar [shared an update](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev//Week-of-Mon-20160815/000608.html) on the status of Swift Package Manager:

> The package manager was a brand new project released with open source Swift, and we have made significant progress as part of Swift 3.0. Starting from that humble beginning we now estimate there are around 3,500 Swift Packages on GitHub (*), with more and more showing up every day.
>
> Since release, we have seen a rapid explosion in the package ecosystem with brand new Swift-based web frameworks (like Kitura, Perfect, Vapor, and Zewo), tooling and infrastructure (like the IBM Package Catalog and swiftenv), or simply adoption by existing popular Swift frameworks (like Alamofire, SnapKit, SwiftJSON, and RxSwift).
>
> We wanted to lay out our plans for the package manager with regard to the upcoming Swift 3.0 release, some project status, and a bit about our future directions.
>
> #### Release Plan
>
> Our `swift-3.0` branch was cut along with the Swift compiler project and will be our final release branch for the Swift 3.0 release. At this point, the only changes we anticipate taking onto the branch are ones that have significant impact on our current user base (primarily those focused on server-side Swift development).
>
> Swift 3.0 will be the first official release including the package manager, which is also shipping as a command line tool inside Xcode 8. We are looking forward to seeing the ecosystem develop as these tools GM alongside the now source stable Swift 3.0!
