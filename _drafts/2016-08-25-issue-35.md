Like last week, the [swift-evolution](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/) list is unusually quiet, with few responses from the Core Team. As you know, we're in beta 6 of Xcode 8, Swift 3, and Apple's various OSes. With August coming to an end, we should expect GM releases pretty soon. The focus right now is still on finishing up and refining this release.

### Repositories

A number of new repositories have shown up under the [Apple GitHub organization](https://github.com/apple). Most relevant to this community would be the new [Xcode playground support](https://github.com/apple/swift-xcode-playground-support) project &mdash; *Logging and communication to allow Swift toolchains to communicate with Xcode.*

The other new repositories are all related to the [Calendar and Contacts Server](https://www.calendarserver.org) project, which is a standards-compliant server implementing the CalDAV and CardDAV protocols. The project is accompanied by a number of sub-projects, all prefixed with "ccs".

This project isn't particularly relevant to the Swift community, although it is interesting to see more open source projects from Apple being hosted on GitHub. It was originally [released in 2006 at WWDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_and_Contacts_Server), but I'm not sure if it had been open source before this week or not (perhaps on [opensource.apple.com](https://opensource.apple.com)).

Calendar and Contacts Server repositories:

- [ccs-calendarserver](https://github.com/apple/ccs-calendarserver)
- [ccs-twistedextensions](https://github.com/apple/ccs-twistedextensions)
- [ccs-pysecuretransport](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pysecuretransport)
- [ccs-pyosxframeworks](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pyosxframeworks)
- [ccs-pycalendar](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pycalendar)
- [ccs-caldavtester](https://github.com/apple/ccs-caldavtester)
- [ccs-pykerberos](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pykerberos)
- [ccs-caldavclientlibrary](https://github.com/apple/ccs-caldavclientlibrary)
- [ccs-pyopendirectory](https://github.com/apple/ccs-pyopendirectory)

### Commits and pull requests

John McCall [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4448) some bugs with dynamic casting: (1) fixed the cast optimizer to handle CF/NS bridging correctly, and (2) fixed the dynamic cast runtime to handle `class` and `enum` casts to `AnyHashable` correctly. This should unblock the fix for [SR-2388](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2388).

Doug Gregor [removed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4431) a ton of dead code. 🤓

Brian Gesiak [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4437) a new driver option: `swiftc -continue-building-after-errors`.

Brian Gesiak [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4367) another new driver option: `swiftc -driver-time-compilation`. This option measures the amount of time each step of the compilation process takes. Here's an example:

```
$ swiftc -emit-library -module-name Crispix \
    Crispix/A.swift Crispix/B.swift Crispix/C.swift \
    -driver-time-compilation
===-------------------------------------------------------------------------===
                            Driver Time Compilation
===-------------------------------------------------------------------------===
  Total Execution Time: 0.0000 seconds (0.0875 wall clock)

   ---Wall Time---  --- Name ---
   0.0245 ( 28.0%)  link Crispix/A.swift Crispix/B.swift Crispix/C.swift
   0.0211 ( 24.1%)  compile Crispix/A.swift
   0.0209 ( 23.9%)  compile Crispix/B.swift
   0.0176 ( 20.1%)  compile Crispix/C.swift
   0.0035 (  4.0%)  swift-autolink-extract Crispix/A.swift Crispix/B.swift Crispix/C.swift
   0.0875 (100.0%)  Total
```

You can even add the flag to your Xcode project settings, in order to have time measurements printed to your build logs.

Maxim Moiseev & Daniel Dunbar implemented proposal [SE-0137](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0137-avoiding-lock-in.md). You can find the various pull requests here: [swift (1)](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4361), [swift (2)](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4391), [swift (3)](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4406), [swift-package-manager (1)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/592), [swift-package-manager (2)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/613).

### Proposals

No new proposals! There's nothing in review, upcoming, or waiting to be scheduled. We should take this rare opportunity to relax and take stock of Swift 3.0.

Note: there are seven proposals that were accepted for Swift 3 but were not implemented. Those will be rolling into a subsequent release. You can find them on the [proposal status page](http://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/).

### Mailing lists

Daniel Dunbar [shared an update](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev//Week-of-Mon-20160815/000608.html) on the status of Swift Package Manager:

> The package manager was a brand new project released with open source Swift, and we have made significant progress as part of Swift 3.0. Starting from that humble beginning we now estimate there are around 3,500 Swift Packages on GitHub (*), with more and more showing up every day.
>
> Since release, we have seen a rapid explosion in the package ecosystem with brand new Swift-based web frameworks (like Kitura, Perfect, Vapor, and Zewo), tooling and infrastructure (like the IBM Package Catalog and swiftenv), or simply adoption by existing popular Swift frameworks (like Alamofire, SnapKit, SwiftJSON, and RxSwift).
>
> We wanted to lay out our plans for the package manager with regard to the upcoming Swift 3.0 release, some project status, and a bit about our future directions.
>
> #### Release Plan
>
> Our `swift-3.0` branch was cut along with the Swift compiler project and will be our final release branch for the Swift 3.0 release. At this point, the only changes we anticipate taking onto the branch are ones that have significant impact on our current user base (primarily those focused on server-side Swift development).
>
> Swift 3.0 will be the first official release including the package manager, which is also shipping as a command line tool inside Xcode 8. We are looking forward to seeing the ecosystem develop as these tools GM alongside the now source stable Swift 3.0!
