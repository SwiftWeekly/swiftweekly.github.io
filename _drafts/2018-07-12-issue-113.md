Welcome to the 113th issue of Swift Weekly Brief! This week was more calm, no news explosions. The repositories and Swift.org discussions had their usual activity.

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-8135](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8135) [Package Manager] SwiftPM should only check for `clang` if it is needed
- [SR-8137](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8137) [Package Manager] Provide mechanism to disable color diagnostics from commands
- [SR-8138](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8138) [Package Manager] Mechanism to limit the parallelism of `swift test --parallel`
- [SR-8139](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8139) [Package Manager] Executable init template is broken when there is a dash in package name
- [SR-8173](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8172) [Tooling] `(T)` Reported as Single-Element Tuple Rather Than `T`

### Swift Unwrapped

In [episode 65](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/160476), Jesse and JP discuss [SE-0213: Literal initialization via coercion](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0213-literal-init-via-coercion.md) proposal, it's implementation and discussion around it.

Hosts [taking some weeks off](https://twitter.com/swift_unwrapped/status/1016334803648434176). Hope to hear them soon!

### News and community

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r) noticed the right thing: when Codable is awesome, it requires [so much boilerplate](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/1655/files#diff-31d171cad93e680d3ffc6cb3c4fc6848R13) to support enums. It will be great if compiler could support it itself.

### Commits and pull requests

[Mark Lacey](https://github.com/rudkx) opened [PR request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17691) to remove Swift 3 from type checher. "Goodbye, Swift 3"

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged several PRs: [PR 1](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17611), [PR 2](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17651), [PR 3](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17816) - great additions to [SE-0156: Class and Subtype existentials](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0156-subclass-existentials.md) to support for protocols with superclass constraints.

[Tony Allevato](https://github.com/allevato) [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15593) changed to add Unicode properties to Unicode.Scalar. It's a result of [discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-unicode-properties-to-unicodescalar-character/9310) from forum.

### New proposals

[Boris BÃ¼gling](https://github.com/neonichu) [finished](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/873/files) proposal `Add Package Manager Dependency Mirroring`. 
> This is a proposal for adding support for dependency mirroring in SwiftPM.

### Accepted proposals

[Amendment SE-0202: Remove `Collection.randomElement` requirement](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/863) is accepted.

[SE-216: User-defined dynamically callable types](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0216-dynamic-callable.md) is [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-216-user-defined-dynamically-callable-types/14110)

### Proposals in review

[SE-017: Introducing the !! "Unwrap or Die" operator to the Swift Standard Library](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0217-bangbang.md) was passed to active review from June 30. 

[SE-0218: Introduce compactMapValues to Dictionary](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0218-introduce-compact-map-values.md) was passed to active review from July 5.

### Swift Forums

Tone Parker [started a pitch](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-move-urlsession-to-new-foundationnetworking-module/14002) to move URLSession and related types to a new library.

> Some of the feedback we've received from the SwiftNIO team is that Foundation's dependency on libcurl brings in too many other libraries
> ...
> I propose a moving the networking types (except URL and URLComponents) into another library, with a working name of swift-corelibs-foundation-networking.

> This change means that there would be a clear dependency graph for the 3 projects: 
> swift-corelibs-foundation-networking -> SwiftNIO -> swift-corelibs-foundation

> Benefits:
> SwiftNIO would be able to use core Foundation types.
> swift-corelibs-foundation-networking could use SwiftPM to build itself.

### Finally

[Wonder if it runs Swift?](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/1016534163988496384)
