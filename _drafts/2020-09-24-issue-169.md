### Podcasts

In the latest episode of Swift Unwrapped, [Jesse](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires)
and [JP](https://twitter.com/simjp) talk [about
Swift 5.3](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/DasaMAiV).

### News and community

[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN) started [a blog series](https://belkadan.com/blog/2020/08/Swift-Runtime-Heap-Objects/) about the Swift runtime. You can give your feedback in this [forum thread](https://forums.swift.org/t/blog-series-the-swift-runtime/40296).

[Max Desiatov](https://twitter.com/maxdesiatov) wrote [a blog post](https://desiatov.com/swift-webassembly-2020/) about the state of Swift for WebAssembly in 2020 (and earlier).

[Tryolabs](https://tryolabs.com/) shared [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFPrypPBpU) - deep dive into Swift for Tensorflow.

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd/) wrote [a blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-on-windows/) introducing Swift on Windows.

### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33998) that introduces `@actorIndependent` attribute.

[Karoy Lorentey](https://twitter.com/lorentey) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-se-0282-experimental/pull/1) that implements atomic strong references, which were a fun way to prove the versatility of the atomics API. Incidentally, they may also become a convenient default solution for memory reclamation in concurrent Swift data structures.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33972) that extends diagnostics and code completion to help guide developers toward implementing function builders.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0288](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0288-binaryinteger-ispower.md): *Adding isPower(of:) to BinaryInteger* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0288-adding-ispower-of-to-binaryinteger/40325).

> Checking some mathematical properties of integers (e.g. parity, divisibility, etc.) is widely used in scientific and engineering applications. Swift brings a lot of convenience when performing such checks, thanks to the relevant methods (e.g. `isMultiple(of:)`) provided by the standard library. However there are still some other cases not yet supported. One of those useful checks that are currently missing is to tell if an integer is power of another, of which the implementation is non-trivial. Apart from inconvenience, user-implemented code can bring inefficiency, poor readability, and even incorrectness. To address this problem, this proposal would like to add a public API `isPower(of:)`, as an extension method, to the `BinaryInteger` protocol.

### Swift Forums

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) discussed how to clarify the behavior of [SE-0268](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0268-didset-semantics.md) with a mutating getter.

> Namely, if a property wrapper has a mutating getter but a non-mutating setter, and the `didSet` body refers to `oldValue`, the synthesized setter has to be mutating as well, since it calls the getter to load `oldValue`. However in the current implementation, if the `didSet` body does not refer to `oldValue`, the setter is made non-mutating.

[Ben Cohen](https://twitter.com/airspeedswift) [addressed an issue](https://forums.swift.org/t/addressing-unimplemented-evolution-proposals/40322] with unimplemented evolution proposals.

> The core team has recently been discussing of a number of proposals that have been accepted but not implemented. You can see a list of these proposals on the [evolution dashboard](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/#?search=Accepted).
> 
> The core team feels that it's important to avoid a situation where evolution proposals remain accepted but unimplemented for long periods of time. The main cause of this was eliminated through the requirement that proposals come with an implementation prior to review. Some unimplemented proposals pre-date this rule. Another cause can be proposals that are implemented, but the implementation is not quite ready for production use. Finally, several proposals are mostly implemented, except for some small portion that proved problematic or was missed.

[Jonathan G](https://forums.swift.org/u/1oo7) started a thread about updating Swift.org API guidelines regarding **get** in function names.

>  I think this current situation is a direct consequence of the fact that our Swift API guidelines do not explicitly say not to use **get** for functions that return a value.

> So my pitch is that we should update the Swift.org API design guidelines with the same basic guidelines about the use of **get** in method names as was found in the Cocoa guidelines

[Lily Ballard](https://forums.swift.org/u/lily_ballard) wrote [a post](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0268-refine-didset-semantics-and-unexpected-interaction-with-exclusive-memory-access/40364) explaining issue with Xcode 12 having unexpected consequence of [SE-0268](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0268-didset-semantics.md) new *simple* `_modify` semantics. In short, code that previously ran just fine will now fail at runtime with a simultaneous access error.

> The issue lies in interactions with optional chaining and an assignment expression that references the property. In particular, with the non-simple version, the synthesized `_modify` coroutine yields a reference to a stack-allocated copy of the value, and therefore does not hold memory access on the property during the yield. But in the new version, it holds `[modify] [dynamic]` access during the yield. Without optional chaining this is generally fine, as the right-hand side of the assignment is evaluated before the _modify is invoked, but with optional chaining it has to defer evaluating the right-hand side until it's verified that the property's value is nonnull.

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://twitter.com/compnerd/) started [a thread](https://forums.swift.org/t/enabling-static-linking-on-windows/40509) discussing about enabling static linking on Windows.

> Windows has definitely come a far way from when it started. However, one feature that still is not available on Windows is static linking. Everything currently requires dynamic linking, which is a bit unfortunate. Although, technically, the Microsoft linker can resolve the imported symbol, it comes at a cost (binary size and runtime overheads, and unnecessary warnings). It would be wonderful to get this issue resolved. Even then, it results in over-exposure of the interfaces, which is another source of issues. However, going the other way has even bigger problems, and given that dynamic linkage is generally preferable, it is what I focused on initially.
