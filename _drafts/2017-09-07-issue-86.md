Welcome back to the weekly! The Swift project repos continue to delight with their usual activity. This week has new starter tasks, updates on proposals, and most excitingly, Chris Lattner's appearance on Swift Unwrapped to talk about concurrency in Swift 5. 

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-5832](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5832): Eliminate curried function representation from ASTs
- [SR-5819](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5819): Suggest `as? AnyHashable` when `as? Equatable` or `as? Hashable` is attempted
- [SR-5817](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5817): Swift CMake prints "Building Swift standard library and SDK overlays" and "Building Swift runtime", even when those are *not* being built
- [SR-5789](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5789): Fixit when failed reference to member named `subscript` could refer to subscript declaration

### Swift Unwrapped

In Episode 27: [Concurrency with Chris Lattner](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/84323), JP and Jesse welcome Chris Lattner to the show to discuss concurrency in Swift 5 and beyond.

### News and community

LLVM 5.0.0 version [is completed](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2017-September/117136.html) and marked as final. In a few days it will be published on LLVM's web-page.

[Greg Heo](https://gregheo.com) published an article called ["The Strange Case Of Mapping Over Optionals"](https://swiftunboxed.com/lang/optionals-map-flatmap/) on the Swift Unboxed portal. Greg described differences in using map and flatMap in details with collections, what exact types is get after applying map or flatMap.

[Kyle Murray](https://github.com/krilnon) implemented an [improvement](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/747) for [proposals status page](http://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/). As all proposals a required in implementation, status page now show a link to those implementations. You can check preview [here](https://krilnon.github.io/swift-evolution/#?search=apple).

John McCall [speaks](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2017/08/29/swift-4-bridging-peephole-for-as-casts/) about bridging conversions for "as" cast.

Vincent Benony wrote an [article](https://www.hopperapp.com/blog/?p=219) about injecting methods in swift at runtime. If you really need this this article might help you.

Mike Ash took a closer look at Swift's error handling: what is the similarity and differences with exceptions - and did a great [post](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2017-08-25-swift-error-handling-implementation.html) about.

"Over-abstraction" idea in Swift is expanded in [blog post](http://belkadan.com/blog/2017/09/Over-abstraction/).

### Commits and pull requests

[Greg Spiers](https://github.com/gspiers) [pushed](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/707) draft proposal about [Ownership on protocol property requirements](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170501/036495.html) and enriched it with [draft implementation](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11744).

[Xi Ge](https://github.com/nkcsgexi) [implemented SR-5746](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11711/files) a refactoring action to simplify long number literal format.

[Brian Gesiak](https://github.com/modocache) merged pull request: ["Link static libraries as PUBLIC"](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11703). Now swiftBasic library is specified as **PUBLIC**, not **INTERFACE**, which means each library that uses swiftBasic now has direct dependency on it.

[Joe Groff](https://github.com/jckarter) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11730) pull requres to support [SE-0161: Smart KeyPaths: Better Key-Value Coding for Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0161-key-paths.md).

[Andrew Trick](https://github.com/atrick) [made](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11753) a cleanup of both ownership classification and
verification.

[Slava Pestov](https://github.com/slavapestov) opened [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11786) to fix redundant constraints for confusing generated interface from *protocol P : AnyObject*.

### Updates on proposals

[SE-0155](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0155-normalize-enum-case-representation.md) *Normalize Enum Case Representation* [got](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4691?focusedCommentId=28297&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-28297) implementation.

[SE-0075](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0075-import-test.md) *Adding a Build Configuration Import Test* is [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/087d3fa5034719e3c3e5076bcec9af80af04c319) in Swift 4.1.

[SE-0183](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0183-substring-affordances.md) *Substring performance affordances* is [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/f19236c66a4e1a3d1c6914e6f21c871b40d3329e) in Swift 4.0.

[SE-0104](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md) *Protocol-oriented integers* is [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/abe20baea443b7aa7ffe22a4d1202df442d9a434) in Swift 4.0.


### Proposals in review

[SE-0184](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0184-unsafe-pointers-add-missing.md): *Unsafe[Mutable][Raw][Buffer]Pointer: add missing methods, adjust existing labels for clarity, and remove deallocation size* by Kelvin Ma is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-September/000401.html).

> Swiftâ€™s pointer types are an important interface for low-level memory manipulation, but the current API design is not very consistent, complete, or convenient.
>
> This proposal seeks to improve the Swift pointer API by ironing out naming inconsistencies, adding sensible default argument values, adding missing methods, and reducing excessive verbosity, offering a more convenient, more sensible, and less bug-prone API. We also attempt to introduce a buffer pointer API that supports partial initialization without excessively compromising memory state safety.

### Mailing lists

Fabian Ehrentraud [wrote](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170828/039396.html) very informative email of Decodable and 'required' initializers dependency.

Joe Groff sent an [email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170828/039349.html) to resume discussion about async coroutines implementation in Swift.

### Finally

[This](https://twitter.com/jamesthomson/status/905056942053306369) is really confusing.
