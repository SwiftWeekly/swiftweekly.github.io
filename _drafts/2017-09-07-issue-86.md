### Starter tasks

- [SR-5832](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5832): Eliminate curried function representation from ASTs
- [SR-5819](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5819): Suggest `as? AnyHashable` when `as? Equatable` or `as? Hashable` is attempted
- [SR-5817](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5817): Swift CMake prints "Building Swift standard library and SDK overlays" and "Building Swift runtime", even when those are *not* being built
- [SR-5789](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5789): Fixit when failed reference to member named `subscript` could refer to subscript declaration

### Swift Unwrapped

In Episode 27: [Concurrency with Chris Lattner](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/84323), JP and Jesse welcome Chris Lattner to the show to discuss concurrency in Swift 5 and beyond.

### News and community

LLVM 5.0.0 version [is completed](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2017-September/117136.html) and marked as final. In a few days it will be published on LLVM's web-page. 

[Greg Heo](https://gregheo.com) published a good article called ["The Strange Case Of Mapping Over Optionals"](https://swiftunboxed.com/lang/optionals-map-flatmap/) on the Swift Unboxed portal. Greg described differences in using map and flatMap in details with collections, what exact types is get after applying map or flatMap.

[Kyle Murray](https://github.com/krilnon) implemented an [improvement](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/747) for [proposals status page](http://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/). As all proposals a required in implementation, status page now show a link to those implementations. You can check preview [here](https://krilnon.github.io/swift-evolution/#?search=apple)

John McCall [speaks](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2017/08/29/swift-4-bridging-peephole-for-as-casts/) about bridging conversions for "as" cast. 

Vincent Benony wrote an [article](https://www.hopperapp.com/blog/?p=219) about injecting methods in swift at runtime. If you really need this this article might help you.

Mike Ash took a closer look at Swift's error handling: what is the similarity and differences with exceptions - and did a great [post](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2017-08-25-swift-error-handling-implementation.html) about. 

### Commits and pull requests

[Greg Spiers](https://github.com/gspiers) [pushed](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/707) draft proposal about [Ownership on protocol property requirements](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170501/036495.html) and enriched it with [draft implementation](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11744).

[Xi Ge](https://github.com/nkcsgexi) [implemented SR-5746](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11711/files) a refactoring action to simplify long number literal format. 

[Brian Gesiak](https://github.com/modocache) merged pull request: ["Link static libraries as PUBLIC"](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11703). Now swiftBasic library is specified as **PUBLIC**, not **INTERFACE**, which means each library that uses swiftBasic now has direct dependency on it. 

[Joe Groff](https://github.com/jckarter) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11730) pull requres to support [SE-0161: Smart KeyPaths: Better Key-Value Coding for Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0161-key-paths.md).

[Andrew Trick](https://github.com/atrick) [made](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11753) a cleanup of both ownership classification and
verification.

### Updates on proposals

> TODO
[SE-0155](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0155-normalize-enum-case-representation.md) *Normalize Enum Case Representation* [got](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4691?focusedCommentId=28297&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-28297) implementation 

[SE-0075](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0075-import-test.md) *Adding a Build Configuration Import Test* is [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/087d3fa5034719e3c3e5076bcec9af80af04c319) in Swift 4.1.

[SE-0183](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0183-substring-affordances.md) *Substring performance affordances* is [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/f19236c66a4e1a3d1c6914e6f21c871b40d3329e) in Swift 4.0.

[SE-0104](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md) *Protocol-oriented integers* is [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/abe20baea443b7aa7ffe22a4d1202df442d9a434) in Swift 4.0.


### Proposals in review

[SE-0184](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0184-unsafe-pointers-add-missing.md): *Unsafe[Mutable][Raw][Buffer]Pointer: add missing methods, adjust existing labels for clarity, and remove deallocation size* by Kelvin Ma is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-September/000401.html).

> Swift’s pointer types are an important interface for low-level memory manipulation, but the current API design is not very consistent, complete, or convenient.
>
> This proposal seeks to improve the Swift pointer API by ironing out naming inconsistencies, adding sensible default argument values, adding missing methods, and reducing excessive verbosity, offering a more convenient, more sensible, and less bug-prone API. We also attempt to introduce a buffer pointer API that supports partial initialization without excessively compromising memory state safety.
