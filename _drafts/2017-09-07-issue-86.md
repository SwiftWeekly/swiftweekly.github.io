### Proposals in review

[SE-0184](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0184-unsafe-pointers-add-missing.md): `Unsafe[Mutable][Raw][Buffer]Pointer: add missing methods, adjust existing labels for clarity, and remove deallocation size` by Kelvin Ma is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-September/000401.html).

> Swiftâ€™s pointer types are an important interface for low-level memory manipulation, but the current API design is not very consistent, complete, or convenient.
>
> This proposal seeks to improve the Swift pointer API by ironing out naming inconsistencies, adding sensible default argument values, adding missing methods, and reducing excessive verbosity, offering a more convenient, more sensible, and less bug-prone API. We also attempt to introduce a buffer pointer API that supports partial initialization without excessively compromising memory state safety.
