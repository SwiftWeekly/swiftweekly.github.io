The last two weeks were pretty silent, but I assume it will change soon right before the official Apple platform releases. I think we will see a lot of going on in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!

### News and community

[Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) [announced](https://www.github.com/apple/swift-cluster-membership) [Swift Cluster Membership](https://swift.org/blog/swift-cluster-membership/) - library aims to help Swift grow in a new space of server applications: clustered multi-node distributed systems.

Google published [SwiftLogFireCloud Firebase Extension](https://github.com/google/swiftlogfirecloud) - library that can be used as an implementation of Apple's SwiftLog interface that captures console logs from iOS and in future macOS apps and pushes them to Firebase Cloud Storage as flat files for later review.

[Peter Steinberger](https://twitter.com/steipete) wrote [an article](https://steipete.com/posts/logging-in-swift/) explaining logging in Swift.

Apple posted [an article](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=3bwfq45y) about what's new in CryptoKit. Great to see that they mention [a talk](https://www.dotconferences.com/2020/02/cory-benfield-cryptography-in-swift) from community organized conference [dotSwift](https://www.dotswift.io/).


### Commits and pull requests

[Varun Gandhi](https://github.com/varungandhi-apple) create [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33786) that addd first pull request guide and getting started guide.

[Saleem Abdulrasool](https://github.com/compnerd) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33770) that fixes [SR-13449](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13449): *Wrong method call when binary is built with optimizations*.

[Owen Voorhees](https://github.com/owenv) merge [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29735) implements [SE-0284](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0284-multiple-variadic-parameters.md): *Allow Multiple Variadic Parameters in Functions, Subscripts, and Initializers*.

[Meghana Gupta](https://github.com/meg-gupta) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/33722) fixes `KnownSafety` optimization bugs in `ARCSequenceOpts`.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0289](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0289-function-builders.md): *Function builders* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0289-function-builders/39889).

> This proposal describes function builders, a new feature which allows certain functions (specially-annotated, often via context) to implicitly build up a value from a sequence of components.


### Swift Forums

[Hassan ElDesouky](https://twitter.com/hassanedesouky) [posted](https://forums.swift.org/t/localization-of-compiler-diagnostic-messages/36412/41) a recap about GSoC.

[ArtemC](https://forums.swift.org/u/artemc) [updated](https://forums.swift.org/t/explicit-module-builds-the-new-swift-driver-and-swiftpm/36990/17) about on the progress that [Xi_Ge](https://forums.swift.org/u/xi_ge), [Douglas_Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) and I have been making on this project, spanning the [Swift compiler](https://github.com/apple/swift), new [Swift driver](https://github.com/apple/swift-driver), and [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager).

> SwiftPM can now self-host using Explicit Module Builds. The package manager itself is a reasonably complex Swift package, and building it exercises most of the new machinery across the involved components. This was an important milestone for getting the basics of the new compilation flow functional.

[Bruno Rocha](https://twitter.com/rockbruno_) [pitched](https://forums.swift.org/t/support-negative-availability-literals/39946) an idea about negative version checks.

> Negative availability checks are important when an API is completely different across versions. In the case of iOS apps that support Scenes, you need a negative availability check in your AppDelegate to account for the fact that UIWindows should be loaded elsewhere in iOS 13+.

[Ray Fix](https://forums.swift.org/u/ray_fix) started [a discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/throw-on-nil/39970) about throwing on nil.

> I find myself wanting to define an operation that converts failable initializers to throwing ones. When I have a throwing initializer contains multiple failing initializers, I think it improves the clarity and readability.

[Ashley Garland](https://forums.swift.org/u/bitjammer) [asked for feedback](https://forums.swift.org/t/diagnostic-for-undocumented-public-declarations/39980) on emitting a diagnostic when a public declaration does not have a documentation comment.

[Greg Titus](https://forums.swift.org/u/gregtitus) pitched an improvement that would make `LazyMapCollections` use the `Sequence` behavior for prefix calls, rather than the `Collection` behavior.

[John McCall](https://forums.swift.org/u/john_mccall) started a discussion on how to represent `async/await` in SIL.

[Alessio Buratti](https://forums.swift.org/u/alessioburatti) asked a question of why `@usableFromInline` is preferred to `private`.

> This is a great question! To answer it thoroughly we need to take a digression into the Swift optimiser and optimisation boundaries, but the TL;DR is that `@usableFromInline` is required to make substantial chunks of NIO perform better.

[Danny Sung](https://forums.swift.org/u/dannys42) posted [news](https://forums.swift.org/t/community-1st-steps-github-org-transition/40114) about Kitura migration to Github organization.

[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN) asked [a question](https://forums.swift.org/t/guarantee-in-memory-tuple-layout-or-dont/40122): Are non-homogeneous tuples guaranteed to use the in-order, rounding-up layout that frozen structs on Apple platforms use?
