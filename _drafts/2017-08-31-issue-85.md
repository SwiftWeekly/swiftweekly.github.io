This week is quieter than previous week on big news, but rich of various concurrency discussions. And SE-0184: *Improved pointers* got some updates and is waiting to get back into the swift-evolution repository.

### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 26: Swift 5 Goals](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/84324), Jesse and JP share their thoughts on the newly announced goals for Swift 5.

### News and community

This week, a [discussion](https://twitter.com/NachoSoto/status/874336844757975040) came up regarding problems with diagnostics and type checker modules. Swift can still improve [a lot](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5198) on diagnostics and error messages to make a smoother migration from Swift 3 to Swift 4.

[Xi Ge](https://github.com/nkcsgexi) wrote a blog post on [Swift local refactoring](https://swift.org/blog/swift-local-refactoring/), giving some great insight into Xcode 9's new refactoring tools.

### Commits and pull requests

[Robert Widmann](https://github.com/CodaFi) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11613) with an implementation for [SE-0075](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0075-import-test.md). That took a while...

[Slava Pestov](https://github.com/slavapestov) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11637) a problem the static instead of the dynamic `Self` type was used in a convenience initializer required by a protocol extension. Appearantly corelibs was relying on that bug, so he [proposed](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/1191) a fix there as well.

Currently "subscript" mangled name contains itself inside, e.g., _T04test3FooC9**(subscript)**yycfg. [Alex Hoppen](https://github.com/ahoppen) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11283) pull request request according to [SR-5506: "Change name mangling of subscripts to no longer contain the string 'subscript'"](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5506) to make subscript mangled name more consistent with others: use "fS" like "fC" for constructors and "fD" for destructors.

[Jordan Rose](https://github.com/jrose-apple) merged PRs: [Excise "Accessibility" from the compiler](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11504#issuecomment-325472480) and [Update for Swift renames of "Accessibility" to "Access(Level)"](https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb/pull/250/files). It's a cosmetic change, but 100% justified. 
> "Accessibility" has a different meaning for app developers, so we've already deliberately excised it from our diagnostics in favor of terms like "access control" and "access level".

[Eeckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11675) an issue which can crash the compiler when global struct or tuple has one or more elements as an empty type.

[Kelvin Ma](https://github.com/kelvin13) [opened pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/744) with updated version of "SE-0184: Improved pointers".

### Proposals

No updates this week! See the [status page here](http://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/).

### Mailing lists

Adam Kemp came up with [discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170828/039280.html) of scope of "await" keyword to clarify how exactly "await" is applied in case there're several functions call in one line. From Chris Lattner: 
> Yes, this is a reasonable concern. We debated it heavily in the Swift 2 timeframe when introducing error handling (as other’s have pointed out, it works the same way). This is a tradeoff between the readability benefits of marking non-obvious control flow vs the readability disadvantage of having noise in the code. Requiring marking on every async or throwing call is particularly bad in the case of chaining. 
> ....
> I believe that this design has served the community well, and I haven’t heard of serious problems with it. I’m pretty confident that async following the same model will have similar success.

Jakob Egger's [Fixing race conditions in async/await example](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170814/039039.html) is still actively discussed on malinig list. 

Howard Lovatt come up with interesting things to discuss: [Reactive streams as building blocks for actors etc](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170828/039296.html). 
> Many of the currently popular server side frameworks are switching to Reactive Streams for their underlying communication, including Akka.
which is definitely true. Christ Lattern added this into [Further extensions](https://gist.github.com/lattner/31ed37682ef1576b16bca1432ea9f782#further-extensions), maybe we'll get this some day!

Logan Shire's [Pitch](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170821/039186.html) with improvement to KeyPath. 
> Firstly, KeyPath does not provide the name of the property on the type it indexes.
> ....
> All I want is to be able to access:
> keyPath.propertyName // “firstName”
> ....
>  I would really like to be able to retrieve a type-erased array of any type’s key paths
> ....
> And finally, without straying too far into Objective-C land, it would be nice if we could initialize key paths with a throwing initializer.

And another topics about concurrency: [Two thoughts on concurrency](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170821/039196.html).
> ....
> And so when I’m reading through this onslaught of emails, I’m troubled by how everything is seeming to require new keywords. There’s the obvious async/await, but there’s also been discussion of actor, reliable, distributed, behavior, message, and signal (and I’ve probably missed others).
> ....
> .... but can we get some clarification on some limits of reasonableness? What restraint (if any) should we be exercising as we consider this feature? Related to the explosion of keywords is the question of whether the concurrency model is going to be a language feature or a library feature.
> ....
> Please don’t all break out your pitchforks at once. 😄
