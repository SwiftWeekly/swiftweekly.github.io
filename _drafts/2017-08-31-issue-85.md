### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 26: Swift 5 Goals](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/84324), Jesse and JP discuss Swift 5 future, consider sensational swift-evolution thread [Swift 5: start your engines](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170807/038645.html) and [swift evolution document](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/README.md): key focus, changes to evolution process in contrast to Swift 4 cycle. 

### News and community

This week come up with a [discussion](https://twitter.com/NachoSoto/status/874336844757975040) about problems of diagnostics and type checker modules. Swift users get a [lot of frustration](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5198) around diagnostics and error messages for type-inferred closures during migration from Swift 3+ to Swift 4.0.

### Commits and pull requests

[Robert Widmann](https://github.com/CodaFi) opened PR: [Implement SE-0075: CanImport](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11613) to implement proposal "SE-0075: Adding a Build Configuration Import Test". 

[Slava Pestov](https://github.com/slavapestov) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11637) [twice](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11637)(to avoid breaking swift-corelibs-foundation) problem of passing wrong Self into protocol extension in case of convenience initializer. 

[Blog post about Swift local refactoring](https://swift.org/blog/swift-local-refactoring/) now [saved](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11657) into apple/swift repository.

As SE-0184 needs more discussion on the mailing list the document is [reverted](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/b159d48bf5a05e5dcfa83e2e7dbb2f64c15ada27) at this moment. 

Currently "subscript" mangled name contains itself inside, e.g., _T04test3FooC9**(subscript)**yycfg. [Alex Hoppen](https://github.com/ahoppen) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11283) PR request according to [SR-5506: "Change name mangling of subscripts to no longer contain the string 'subscript'"](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5506) to make subscript mangled name more consistent with others: use "fS" like "fC" for constructors and "fD" for destructors.

[Jordan Rose](https://github.com/jrose-apple) merged PRs: [Excise "Accessibility" from the compiler](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11504#issuecomment-325472480) and [Update for Swift renames of "Accessibility" to "Access(Level)"](https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb/pull/250/files). It's a cosmetic change, but 100% justified. 
> "Accessibility" has a different meaning for app developers, so we've already deliberately excised it from our diagnostics in favor of terms like "access control" and "access level".

[Eeckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11675) the issue which can crash compiler when global struct or tuple has one or more elements as an empty type.
