Welcome to issue 49! As of December 3, Swift has been [open source for 1 full year](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/805076141157404672). 😱 🎂 Can you believe it? I'm not sure if it is harder to believe that this was Swift's *first year* of open source development, or that it has *only been 1 year*. Congrats to the Core Team, contributors, and community!

### Starter tasks

- [SR-3181](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3281): [Compiler, Docs] The Swift man page is woefully out of date.
- [SR-3254](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3254): [Compiler] Diagnostics are unhelpful/confusing for compound function name references.
- [SR-3207](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3207): [Compiler] Segmentation fault with Objective-C parameter of type `(NSError* __autoreleasing __nonnull * __nullable)`

### News and community

Ole Begemann wrote an article on [*The RawRepresentable Protocol in Swift*](https://oleb.net/blog/2016/11/rawrepresentable/). If you didn't know, `RawRepresentable` isn't limited to only `enum` types! Great read.

### Commits and pull requests

Robert Widmann [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5778) proposal [SE-0075](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0075-import-test.md): *Adding a Build Configuration Import Test*.

David Jones [further improved](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/723) the performance of JSON serialization on Linux in corelibs-foundation. It looks like improvements range from 1.2-2.2x speed ups.

Slava Pestov [continued](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6069) his factoring of the AST from [last week](/issue-48/), this time completely removing `SubstitutedType`. *"Swift.swiftmodule is 670KB smaller now."* 🎉

Xi Ge fixed a few IDE crashers: [016](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6079), [091](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6084), [012](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6077).

### Accepted Proposals

Proposal [SE-0145](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0145-package-manager-version-pinning.md): *Package Manager Version Pinning* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-December/000302.html).

> This was a revision of a previous proposal, and the feedback to this revised version was generally positive. Most of the feedback and discussion was about what the workflow and default behavior should be for various use cases. There was also some feedback about the name (“pinning” vs “locking”), and feedback that the proposed new JSON file be formatted in a way that is easily diffable. There seemed to be broad agreement that the underlying feature being proposed is a good and important improvement.

> Thank you to Daniel Dunbar for writing this proposal and driving this discussion forward.
