### Starter tasks

- [SR-2695](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2695): The Swift repository contains a handy Python script that updates all of your local checkouts of Swift repositories to the latest commit on `master`. This task adds the ability to checkout a specific tag, such as `swift-2.2.1-RELEASE`.

### Commits and pull requests

> TODO

Airspeed Velocity [numbered and categorized](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4868) each of the FIXMEs associated with ABI stability. Now you can tell your friends about the difficulty of resolving ABI FIXME #104, and they'll know exactly what issue you're referring to.

Jordan Rose [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4568) a pull request to change all CoreFoundation types to conform to `Equatable` and `Hashable` by default. This is a source-breaking change for code that's manually extended a CoreFoundation type to conform to `Equatable` or `Hashable`, and so may be delayed until Swift 4.

Erik Eckstein [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4836) new SIL instructions to support tail-allocated arrays in SIL. Maybe as a result we'll see some improved benchmarks for appaneding objects to an array?

Jordan Rose [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4777) a fix-it for when a trailing closure causes ambiguity as to which function will be called.

Dmitri Gribenko [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4827) documentation on the complexity of `Set.removeFirst()`.

Harlan Haskins [improved](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4683) the error diagnostics for closures that incorrectly take a `var` parameter, such as `myClosure { (var foo) in ... }`.

Graydon Hoare [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4826) a pull request to add a `-swift-version <n>` option. This would allow you to use a the Swift compiler released as "Swift 3.1", but pass the option `-swift-version 2.2.1` to force it to compile code as Swift 2.2.1. Of course, there's no guarantee that a modern Swift compiler could correctly compile Swift 2.2.1 code, but the option to force it to do so is handy.

@kstaring [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4804) a pull request to fix FreeBSD support. Wouldn't it be nice if platform support for FreeBSD and Android never broke? Read the "Mailing lists" section below for news on that front.

Three weeks ago Daniel Dunbar [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/commit/b5dd8e2b3de4c818f153eba3768def42f2781ac6) a new dependency resolver to SwiftPM. This week Ankit Aggarwal [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/665) support for the `update` command. You can try it out yourself by building SwiftPM from source and running `swift package update --enable-new-resolver`.

Ankit Aggarwal [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/669) a bug in which SwiftPM could not be built using an Xcode application that had a space in its name.

Han Sangjin [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild/pull/35) a pull request to fix Cygwin support in llbuild.

@saiHemak [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/648) a pull request to swift-corelibs-foundation to fix JSON serialization for `[true]`.

Ever think you'd be able to ask `@swift-ci please test Android`? Well, Apple is considering additional CI platforms, including one for Android. Brian Gesiak [sent an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160919/002952.html) with a summary of the approach being considered, as well as an offer of additional resources to make it happen.
