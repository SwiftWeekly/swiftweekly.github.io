It was the Chinese philosopher Laozi who said 「千里之行，始於足下」, or "a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step". Oh wait, or was that Joe Groff who said that the journey to Swift 4 begins with a single pull request...?

In any case, with major Apple releases out of the way, the Swift repositories are buzzing with activity. This week, we cover ABI FIXME cataloging, source-breaking changes, and cross-platform developments for Android, FreeBSD, and Cygwin.

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-2627](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2627): The Swift standard library's `UnicodeScalar.utf16` does not have an access modifier, and is therefore considered `internal`. It should be marked `public`.
- [SR-2626](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2626): `String` to `Double` conversion fails on `snan` (signaling NaN) input. The task already has some discussion on the specifics of when exactly the converted value should signal. Some knowledge of Swift and C may be helpful in completing this task.
- [SR-2653](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2653): Add an option to the Swift build script to specify whether to build SourceKit. Basic knowledge of Python, shell scripting, or CMake would be helpful, but not strictly necessary.

### Commits and pull requests

Many private API in libdispatch, Foundation, and XCTest are currently marked `public` due to a [bug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1901) in SIL linkage. This week, Chris Bailey [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/651) a pull request to expose internal variables and methods on `Operation` as a workaround. Brian Gesiak [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/173) a pull request to mark internal variables as `final`, which works around the bug in some cases.

Airspeed Velocity [numbered and categorized](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4868) each of the FIXMEs associated with ABI stability. Now you can tell your friends about the difficulty of resolving ABI FIXME #104, and they'll know exactly which issue you're referring to.

Swift and its tooling is being maintained to work on many different platforms. Han Sangjin [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild/pull/35) Cygwin support in llbuild. K Staring [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4804) a pull request to fix FreeBSD support.

Several improvements have been made to Swift diagnostics' [QoI](https://github.com/apple/swift/blame/c49b171f4bad368cae289bce2acc89cbebfea823/docs/Lexicon.rst#L191-L199). Jordan Rose [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4777) a fix-it for when a trailing closure causes ambiguity as to which function will be called. Harlan Haskins [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4683) a pull request to improve the error diagnostics for closures that incorrectly take a `var` parameter, such as `myClosure { (var foo) in ... }`.

What makes a "source-breaking" change in Swift? Sometimes it's not clear. Slava Pestov [changed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4878) variadic closure arguments to be `@escaping` by default, which is technically a source breaking change, but only for invalid code. Jordan Rose [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4568) a pull request to change all CoreFoundation types to conform to `Equatable` and `Hashable` by default. Jordan's pull request is a source-breaking change, but only for code that's manually extended a CoreFoundation type to conform to `Equatable` or `Hashable`. Unfortunately, some code that does just that was found on GitHub, and so his changes may be delayed until Swift 4.

Doug Gregor [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4875) [SR-993](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-993), a bug in which `static let` variables defined on Objective-C class extensions would be inferred to be both `final` and `dynamic`.

Erik Eckstein [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4836) new SIL instructions to support tail-allocated arrays in SIL. Maybe as a result we'll see some improved benchmarks for appending objects to an array?

Graydon Hoare [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4826) a `-swift-version <n>` option. This would allow you to use a the Swift compiler released as "Swift 3.1", but pass the option `-swift-version 2.2.1` to force it to compile code as Swift 2.2.1. Of course, there's no guarantee that a modern Swift compiler could correctly compile Swift 2.2.1 code, but the option to force it to do so is handy.

Three weeks ago Daniel Dunbar [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/commit/b5dd8e2b3de4c818f153eba3768def42f2781ac6) a new dependency resolver to SwiftPM. This week Ankit Aggarwal [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/665) support for the `update` command. You can try it out yourself by building SwiftPM from source and running `swift package update --enable-new-resolver`.

Ankit Aggarwal [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/669) a bug in which SwiftPM could not be built using an Xcode application that had a space in its name.

Slava Pestov [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4849) a massive pull request to refactor code completion and module interface printing in libAST and libIDE.

Joe Groff [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4865) a pull request to implement [SE-0139](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0139-bridge-nsnumber-and-nsvalue.md), NSValue bridging.

### Accepted proposals

Andrew Trick’s proposal, [SE-0138](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0138-unsaferawbufferpointer.md): *UnsafeRawBufferPointer*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160919/027167.html).

> Community feedback to this proposal was nearly all positive. It was
pointed out that Foundation’s Data API should make use of this new type,
and there is a clear intention to do that. The core team agrees that the
proposal is a reasonable addition to make in Swift 3 because it fills in
missing functionality from SE-0107: UnsafeRawPointer and will help with
code migration. As a result of the discussion, the proposed component's
name was changed from `UnsafeBytes` to `UnsafeRawBufferPointer`; that
change is already reflected in the proposal.

### Mailing lists

Ever think you'd be able to ask `@swift-ci please test Android`? Well, Apple is considering additional CI platforms, including one for Android. Brian Gesiak [sent an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160919/002952.html) with a summary of the approach being considered, as well as an offer of additional resources to make it happen.

Between Xcode 7.3.1, Xcode 8, and Xcode 8.1 beta, you probably have more than one Xcode installed right now. Brian Gesiak [asked](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160919/002959.html) about how to compile Swift with a specific version of Xcode. Daniel Dunbar [explained](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160919/002961.html) it can be done by setting the `DEVELOPER_DIR` when compiling.

Updating Xcode is a chore no one is free from -- not even Apple's continuous integration servers. Nicole Jacque [announced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160919/002990.html) some downtime to install Xcode 8.1 beta.

Ron Olson [confirmed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-users/Week-of-Mon-20160919/003336.html) that Swift builds on Ubuntu 16.

### Finally

The long winter is over: Steve T-S is [back](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/776487916180738048) on Twitter. He's uncovered interesting iOS internals like SceneKit's [`SCNHeadMountedDisplayRenderingTechnique`](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/776487557370699776), and [released](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/776528404761997316) a Swift playground that allows you to browse files on your iPad.
