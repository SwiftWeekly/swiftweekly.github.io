### News and community

The 2016 Bay Area LLVM Developers' Meeting was held on November 3rd and 4th. The event focuses on LLVM and Clang, and while none of the speakers referenced Swift specifically, many members of the Swift core team were in attendance. Expect slides from the talks to be released within a week or two. Video recordings will eventually be available as well.

At the meeting, discussions on moving LLVM from SVN onto Git and GitHub continued. Although it was decided that LLVM would move to GitHub, a major roadblock remains: reaching a consensus on whether to have LLVM, Clang, and the various other projects remain in separate repositories as they do today (a "multirepo" approach), or whether all the repositories should be placed in a single repository (a "monorepo").

If you're waiting for LLVM to move to GitHub before you start contributing, don't hold your breath. In the meantime, LLVM's [Getting Started](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) and [Code Reviews with Phabricator](http://llvm.org/docs/Phabricator.html) guides explain how to send patches to LLVM projects.

Chris Bieneman [presented](https://llvmdevelopersmeetingbay2016.sched.org/event/8YzZ/developing-and-shipping-clang-with-cmake) on how migrating Clang's build system from autoconf to CMake has benefited that project. Although the talk did not mention Swift's build system, it's clear that LLVM and Clang's usage of CMake is very different from Swift's.

### Commits and pull requests

Slava Pestov [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5600) a pull request that enables nested types within generic types. This resolves an ABI FIXME in the Swift standard library.

Alex Hoppen [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5533) a pull request to fix a regression [reported](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1976) by Erica Sadun, in which annotating generic parameters to closures arguments as `inout` doesn't quite work. This is an excellent example of a improvement to compiler internals that was both reported and addressed by non-Apple contributors to Swift.

Simon Evans [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5394) a pull request that would allow the Swift package manager to create static libraries on Linux.

David Aghassi [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5645) a pull request to add documentation to SourceKit's `complete.open` request type. SourceKit is largely undocumented, and could use your help! See [SR-2117](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2117) for details.

Xi Ge [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5634) a new SourceKit request type, `range`, which provides information about a selected snippet of code.

Dave Abrahams [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5640) a pull request to improve the Emacs support files included in the Swift repository.
