Welcome to issue #31! [Beta 3](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=07182016a) of Xcode and all the platforms are now available. The most important news this week was Ted Kremenek's email on the *endgame for Swift 3* (see below). The last day for Swift 3 breaking changes is July 27, and discussions on Swift 4 will begin August 1. Moving fast! 😱

### Starter tasks

- [SR-1266](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1266): Fix duplication of `@VARIABLES@` in `test` and `validation-test`. This starter task is from April, but it [continues to cause pain](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3577#issuecomment-233464806) for Swift compiler developers today. The goal of this task is to make it easier for developers to modify the variables being passed to the Swift test suite -- developers currently need to modify two files in two different parts of the codebase. Completing this task would reduce that down to just one file. Basic knowledge of Python would be helpful in completing this task, but is not necessary.
- [SR-2117](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2117): Add documentation for SourceKit request types. SourceKit has a lot of functionality that could be very useful when building developer tools for Swift, but very little documentation on how to use those tools. The goal for this task is to use SourceKit, see what it does, and document its behavior. Being able to read the C++ source code for SourceKit would help, but is not required.

### Community

Brian Gesiak has [hacked together](http://modocache.io/nuclide-swift-ide) Swift support for the [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io) IDE! 🤓

### Commits and pull requests

Jacob Bandes-Storch [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/433) his work on the new [proposal status page](http://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) for swift-evolution. Fancy! ✨

JP Simard is continuing the work of porting SourceKit to Linux. Building Swift from source [now builds](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3595) Brian Croom's in-process implementation of sourcekitd, and will soon [link it against libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3594).

[SE-0095](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0095-any-as-existential.md), which replaces `protocol<P1,P2>` syntax with `P1 & P2` syntax, has been [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/a6dad0091bbb099b1c44d691204b5861e3332a1d) by Josef Willsher.

[SE-0109](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/37ca495862e07ea7cc13c72b934a85501710bf78/proposals/0109-remove-boolean.md), which removes the `Boolean` protocol, has been [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3567). Usages of `Boolean` in the core libraries have been [replaced](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/commit/544608dbf891326f254bb8d048267aa29247742c)  with `Bool`.

### Accepted proposals

> TODO

### Returned proposals

Proposal [SE-0117](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0117-non-public-subclassable-by-default.md): *Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly* from Javier Soto and John McCall was [returned for revision](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000234.html).

> As expected, this proposal was extremely polarizing, with valid arguments on both sides.  The opinions held by supporters and opposers are held very strongly, and hundreds of emails were generated in a healthy debate about this topic.
>
> The review manager read every post on this topic, and the core team discussed this topic at length.  The core team concluded three things:
>
> - First, the core team *agrees with conviction* that it is the right default for public classes to be non-subclassable outside their module, unless they carry some additional indication from the API author that the class was designed to be subclassed.
> - Second, there was insufficient discussion about anything *other* than the first point.  The proposal also contains the “overridable” concept, which is highly impactful, but lacked significant discussion.
> - Third, the core team agrees that the concrete syntax of "subclassable class" is ... suboptimal.
>
> On the first point, there are three related arguments against SE-0117:
>
> - First is that clients of Apple frameworks often choose to subclass classes that Apple publicly documents as being “not for subclassing”, as a way of “getting their job done,” typically as a way to work around claimed bugs in Apple frameworks.  The core team and others at Apple feel that this argument is analogous to the argument that Swift should “support method swizzling by default”.  Swift loves dynamic features, but has already taken a stance against unanticipated method swizzling, by requiring an API author to indicate where they allow method swizzling with the ‘dynamic’ keyword.  Almost all classes vended by Apple APIs are subclassable (which isn’t changed by this proposal) so this argument is not compelling to the core team, nor is it consistent with the existing design of Swift.  It is also important to note that Cocoa also makes heavy use of delegation (via protocols) which allows client code to customize framework behavior without subclassing.
> - Second is that clients of some other public API vended by a non-Apple framework (e.g. a SwiftPM package) may end up in a situation where the framework author didn’t consider subclass-ability, but the client desires it.  In this situation, the core team feels that a bigger problem happened: the vendor of the framework did not completely consider the use cases of the framework.  This might have happened due to the framework not using sufficient black box unit testing, a failure of the imagination of the designer in terms of use cases, or because they have a bug in their framework that needs unanticipated subclass-ability in order to “get a job done”.  Similar to the first point, the core team feels that the language is not the right place to solve this problem.  Instead, there is a simple and general solution: communicate with the framework author and get them to add the capabilities that you desire.  If they simply need to add subclass-ability, then that is no problem: it is a source-compatible change to a dependency.
> - Third is a longer-term meta-concern, wherein a few people are concerned that future pure-Swift APIs will not consider subclass-ability in their design and will accidentally choose-by-omission to prevent subclass-ability on a future pure-Swift API (vended by Apple or otherwise).  The core team feels that this is an extremely unlikely situation for several reasons.  First of which is that it heavily overlaps the first two concerns.  More significantly, any newly-designed and from-scratch APIs that are intended for Swift-only clients will make use of a breadth of abstractions supported by Swift—structs, enums, protocols, classes.  The primary reasons to use classes in Swift are subclassability and reference semantics, so the core team feels that the likelihood of accidental omission is small.  Likewise, the decision to require every member of a public class to be marked public in Swift indicates a commitment (in line with SE-0117) that expects cross-module API authors to think carefully about the API they are authoring as well as their use cases.
>
> To reiterate, as a summary, the core team *agrees with conviction* that it is the right default for public classes to be non-subclassable outside their module, unless they carry some additional indication by the API author that the class was designed to be subclassed.  However, it does not yet have an opinion as to what that concrete syntax is.
>
> To sum this all up, the core team is rejecting this proposal and requesting a revision to change the concrete syntax to `public open class Foo` instead of `subclassable class Foo`.  This approach satisfies the *unwavering* goal of requiring additional thought when publishing a class as public API, makes subclass-ability orthogonal to access control, and (admittedly as a bit of a swift-evolution process hack) asks the community for an in-depth discussion of the secondary points of the proposal: does it make sense to require every member to be marked as `overridable` in order to be overridden by an open subclass outside of the current module?
>
> The core team appreciates that this is a situation where it is impossible to please everyone, while also recognizing that the challenges faced by developers of pure-Swift code are not exactly analogous to those faced by Objective-C developers.  Thank you to the many and diverse opinions and perspectives that have come in as part of this review cycle!

### Proposals in review

Proposal [SE-0117](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0117-non-public-subclassable-by-default.md): *Default classes to be non-subclassable publicly* (mentioned above) from Javier Soto and John McCall is also [under its second review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000236.html).

Proposal [SE-0124](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0124-bitpattern-label-for-int-initializer-objectidentfier.md): *`Int.init(ObjectIdentifier)` and `UInt.init(ObjectIdentifier)` should have a `bitPattern:` label* from Arnold Schwaighofer is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000237.html).

> `Int.init(ObjectIdentifier)` and `UInt.init(ObjectIdentifier)` should have a `bitPattern:` label to make it clear at the use site that we interpret the value as a bit pattern.

### Mailing lists

Ted Kremenek [sent an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000235.html) on the *endgame for Swift 3*, highlighting the development plans for the release and the proposals that have not yet been completed.

> Swift 3 has shaped up to be a remarkable release — a product of the inspiration, ideas, and hard labor many people from across the Swift open source community. It is now time, however, to talk about the endgame for the release.
>
> Here are the key points:
>
> The last day to take planned source-breaking changes for Swift 3 is July 27.
>
> On that day, there will likely be a set of approved-but-not-implemented proposals for Swift 3 &mdash; including proposals for source-breaking changes. Will have an open discussion on that day on the fate of those unimplemented proposals in the context of Swift 3 and future Swift releases.
>
> Starting on August 1 we will open up discussion about Swift 4. Part of this discussion will likely be guided by important work that was deferred from Swift 3, as well as the a goal of achieving binary stability in Swift 4. Until then, however, discussion should remain focused on Swift 3.
>
> Note that there is an intentional gap of a few days between the last planned day to take source-breaking changes for Swift 3 and when we start talking about Swift 4. The idea is to provide some time for the community to take stock of where things have ended up for Swift 3.
>
> The final branching plan for Swift 3 development is to be determined, but the final convergence branch is likely to be cut from master around that date or shortly after. Part of it comes down to the discussion on July 27 on how to handle the remaining unimplemented proposals for Swift 3.
>
> The final release date for Swift 3 is TBD, but essentially after July 27 the intent is that Swift 3 is in full convergence and not in active development.
>
> With these dates in mind, I want to call attention to some approved-but-not-yet-implemented proposals that currently I have nobody on Apple's Swift team able to tackle in the next couple weeks: ...
