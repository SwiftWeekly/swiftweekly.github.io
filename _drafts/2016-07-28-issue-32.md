Yesterday was the big day &mdash; the last day for Swift 3 breaking changes!

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-2083](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2083): [SwiftPM] Don't error if a directory contains only ignored files

### Commits and pull requests

[SE-0102](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0102-noreturn-bottom-type.md) was [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3658) by Slava Pestov. This replaces the `@noreturn` attribute with a return type of `Never`:

{% highlight swift %}
// Old
@noreturn func runAndExit() { /* ... */ }

// New
func runAndExit() -> Never { /* ... */ }
{% endhighlight %}

As part of [SE-0086](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0086-drop-foundation-ns.md), `Process` was [renamed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3598) to `CommandLine`, and `NSTask` was [renamed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3670) to `Process`:

{% highlight swift %}
// Old
let task = NSTask()
task.launchPath = "/usr/bin/echo"
task.arguments = Process.arguments

// New
let process = Process()
process.launchPath = "/usr/bin/echo"
process.arguments = CommandLine.arguments
{% endhighlight %}

Also as a part of [SE-0086](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0086-drop-foundation-ns.md), `OutputStream` was [renamed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3576) to `TextOutputStream` and `NSOutputStream` was [renamed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3667) to `OutputStream`.

Ayaka Nonaka [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3745) changes to import Objective-C's `@compatibility_alias` compiler directive as a Swift `typealias`.

[SE-0131](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0131-anyhashable.md) was [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3554) by Dmitri Gribenko. This adds a type-erased `AnyHashable` container to the standard library.

[SE-0130](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0130-string-initializers-cleanup.md) was [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3758) by Roman Levenstein. This cleans up a number of `String` initializers.

Dave Liu [submitted](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/482) a pull request to implement starter bug [SR-1608](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1608), implementing `NSStream`, `NSInputStream` and `NSOutputStream` in corelibs-foundation.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0128](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0128-unicodescalar-failable-initializer.md): *Change failable UnicodeScalar initializers to failable* by Xin Tong was [reviewed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000252.html) and [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000259.html).

> Feedback was universally positive, and the proposal is straight forward.

[SE-0130](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0130-string-initializers-cleanup.md): *Replace repeating `Character` and `UnicodeScalar` forms of `String.init`* by Roman Levenstein was [reviewed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000253.html) and [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000260.html).

> There was very little public discussion about this proposal, but the core team believes this eliminates a real ambiguity, while leaving doors open for future improved designs.
>
> Thank you to Roman Levenstein for driving this discussion forward.

[SE-0125](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0125-remove-nonobjectivecbase.md): *Remove `NonObjectiveCBase` and `isUniquelyReferenced`* by Arnold Schwaighofer was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000261.html).

> This proposal had significant community feedback to help refine and improve its design, and Arnold has incorporated that into his v2 of the proposal.  The core team agrees the new revision is a good design.
>
> Thank you to Arnold Schwaighofer for driving this discussion forward!

[SE-0127](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0127-cleaning-up-stdlib-ptr-buffer.md): *Cleaning up stdlib Pointer and Buffer Routines* by Charlie Monroe was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000262.html).

> The proposal has been *accepted with a modification*.
>
> This proposal got a significant amount of helpful feedback, which Charlie has already incorporated into the proposal.  The core team requests one additional minor change, which is to drop the addition of the `ObjectIdentifier.unsafeAddress` field.
>
> Thank you to Charlie Monroe for driving this discussion forward!

[SE-0131](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0131-anyhashable.md): *Add `AnyHashable` to the standard library* by Dmitri Gribenko was [reviewed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000254.html) and [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000263.html).

> The feedback on this proposal was quite positive.  A few questions were raised, but were answered on-thread.  Thank you to Dmitri Gribenko for writing this proposal and driving this discussion forward.

### Rejected proposals

[SE-0119](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0119-extensions-access-modifiers.md): *Remove access modifiers from extensions* was [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000250.html).

> The majority of the feedback on this proposal was opposed to it, because it eliminated the useful ability to apply access control to a batch of methods and properties.
>
> Thank you to Adrian Zubarev for raising this proposal.

[SE-0122](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0122-use-colons-for-subscript-type-declarations.md): *Use colons for subscript declarations* was [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000258.html).

> The review of "SE-0122: Use colons for subscript declarations" ran from July 19…24. The proposal has been *rejected*.
>
> The feedback on this proposal from the community was overall divided with a slight bias towards reject.  Reasonable arguments were made on both sides: subscripts are definitely property-like in some ways, but they are also function-like in other ways.  Further, if we were aiming to align declaration syntax with use, arguably the parameter list should be enclosed in square brackets (but to be clear, we’re not going to do that).  Overall, the core team agrees with the pervasive sentiment that this is not important enough to make a change for.
>
> Thank you to James Froggatt for raising this proposal.

### Returned proposals

[SE-0126](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0126-refactor-metatypes-repurpose-t-dot-self-and-mirror.md): *Refactor Metatypes, repurpose `T.self` and `Mirror`*, was [withdrawn for revision](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000251.html).

> The authors of SE-0126 have requested that we withdraw the proposal.  The idea will be revised, return back to the “pitch” phase, and when that converges, SE-0126 will be revised.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0117](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0117-non-public-subclassable-by-default.md): *Allow distinguishing between public access and public overridability*
