### News and community

Swift team superstar [Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/875401073447419904) is taking a Twitter break. Joe has been so helpful and responsive to the community over Twitter and we wish him a good break and safe return! ðŸš£

### Commits and pull requests

Philippe Hausler [noted some feedback](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170612/037499.html) about [SE-0170](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0170-nsnumber_bridge.md) NSNumber bridging to floats and doubles. If you've been burned by floating-point precision in the past, check out [the commit making "Double and Float bridges to be more lenient"](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/c358afe6555e5e32633e879f96a3664dc7a5f3dc).

The Swift migrator library was merged into the repository! At its core, the migrator takes a source file as input and producs a *remap file* describing the proposed changes. Check out all the details in the [Swift migrator library](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/lib/Migrator) folder.

TODO write about ["Allow #if to guard switch case clauses"](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9457/commits/5d478bdb3b7638f5df6f0e1f4e574bececae9b80)

### Finally

What kind of language would *you* build after learning the lessons of Swift? [A very simple one](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/875150641269571584), [perhaps even without access control](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/875153089174446080)? ðŸ˜±
