Keeping us on our toes, the folks at Apple have released a second round of OS betas and Xcode seeds. Check out the [developer portal](https://developer.apple.com) and the Xcode 9 Beta 2 release notes in particular for the latest on improvements and known issues in the bundled Swift 4.

### Starter tasks

Writing tests is a great way to learn about the standard library and language, and also helps the project by preventing future regressions.

* [SR-4824](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4824): Add tests to check Collection constraints are being enforced
* [SR-5040](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5040): Convert "exclude" related functional tests to unit test

### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 16: Error Handling in Swift ‚Äî A History](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/72297), your hosts say the words "rethrows" and "types" many times, reminisce about Objective-C, and uncover the history of error handling in Swift.


### News and community

Swift team superstar [Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/875401073447419904) is taking a Twitter break. Joe has always been helpful and responsive to the community over Twitter, and we wish him a good break and safe return! üö£

Speaking of Joe, [his former intern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntj8ab-5cvE) [Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/877341760812232704) (who you might have heard of) is back on the job market. While he has an impressive [seven years of Swift experience](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/877353276676612102), I suspect most companies will be looking for someone with ten. `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

Now that Xcode 9 and Swift 4 are in beta, it's good to look back at all the proposals that made it into the language. Check out [What‚Äôs New in Swift 4?](https://www.raywenderlich.com/163857/whats-new-swift-4) by [Eric Cerney](https://twitter.com/ecerney) for an excellent summary.

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r/status/877653585844031493) wrote a post on the Swift blog, [Swift Package Manager Manifest API Redesign](https://swift.org/blog/swift-package-manager-manifest-api-redesign/), describing the new manifest API. Swift package descriptions are written in Swift, and the new API / format now follows the language design guidelines.


### Commits and pull requests

Philippe Hausler [noted some feedback](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170612/037499.html) about [SE-0170: NSNumber bridging and Numeric types](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0170-nsnumber_bridge.md) with respect to floats and doubles. If you've been burned by floating-point precision in the past, check out [the commit helping "Double and Float bridges to be more lenient"](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/c358afe6555e5e32633e879f96a3664dc7a5f3dc).

The Swift migrator library was merged into the repository! At its core, the migrator takes a source file as input and producs a *remap file* describing the proposed changes. Check out all the details in the [Swift migrator library](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/lib/Migrator) folder.

Everyone's favorite Swift 4 protocol `Encodable` [gets some upgrades](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/10321) to support non-strong (weak, unowned, unmanaged) properties.

The second bug ever filed in the Swift issue tracker has been fixed! üéâ [SR-2](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2) and [SR-4196](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4196) describe how wrapping switch cases in conditional `#if`/`#endif` blocks doesn't work properly, and this has been [fixed in a recent commit](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9457/commits/5d478bdb3b7638f5df6f0e1f4e574bececae9b80).

Xcode 9 lets you Sanitize All The Things with the new [Undefined Behavior Sanitizer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/code_diagnostics/undefined_behavior_sanitizer) and the [Main Thread Checker](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/code_diagnostics/main_thread_checker) joining the existing address sanitizer and thread sanitizer. Code for these new features was [merged into swift-lldb](https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb/pull/211/commits), so have a look at how they work if you're curious. üîç


### Proposal news

Following up on a [post from last year](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160425/015920.html), [Erica Sadun](https://github.com/erica) and associates [Olivier Halligon](https://github.com/AliSoftware), [Caleb Davenport](https://github.com/calebd), and [Brian King](https://github.com/KingOfBrian) submitted a [draft proposal to add "role keywords"](https://github.com/erica/swift-evolution/blob/2f2778797ceb9edc0b8acd3b68af5f81f9a95775/proposals/XXXX-role-keywords.md) for protocol extension methods.

[SE-0110](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0110-distingish-single-tuple-arg.md) was meant to make obvious the difference between multiple parameters to a function `(String, Int)` and a single tuple parameter `(String, Int)`. They sure do look the same, don't they? As Doug Gregor noted on the mailing list, [this change to the compiler led to some complications](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170619/037616.html):

> Swift 4 implemented more of SE-0110, which caused a fairly serious usability regression, particularly with closures.
>
> [...]
>
> The Swift core team feels that these usability regressions are unacceptable for Swift 4. There are a number of promising solutions that would provide a better model for closures and address the usability regression, but fully designing and implementing those are out of scope for Swift 4.  Therefore, we will ‚Äúback out‚Äù the SE-0110 change regarding function arguments from Swift 4.

No one can tell the future and it's hard to know the effect of a proposal on all the Swift code out there in the world ‚Äî¬†but that's why we have snapshot builds and betas. As for the [fallout around SE-0110](http://ericasadun.com/2017/06/20/more-on-se-0110-important-fallout-please-read/), I think we all join the community in encouraging contributor [Austin Zheng](https://twitter.com/austinzheng/status/877054901620101120) to stick around. ‚ù§Ô∏è

No new proposals but as always, you can check out the [Swift Evolution status page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) for all the details.


### Mailing lists

Remember [SE-0104: Protocol-oriented integers](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md)? [Xiaodi Wu](https://github.com/xwu) posted some [thoughtful notes and suggestions](https://gist.github.com/xwu/d68baefaae9e9291d2e65bd12ad51be2) on improving the implementation.

Halen Wooten kicked off a [great thread on swift-dev](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170619/004829.html) on how to be an effective contributor. I know the mailing list interface can be a bit gnarly, but check out [the entire thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170619/thread.html#4829) for some good tips. From [documentation](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170619/004833.html) to [avoiding clean builds to save time](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170619/004835.html), I hope these tips get collected into some kind of _Getting Started_ guide?


### Finally

What kind of language would *you* build after learning the lessons of Swift? [A very simple one](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/875150641269571584), [perhaps even without access control](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/875153089174446080)? üò±
