### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 18: Community Open Source Spotlight](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/72298), JP and Jesse take a break from Swift itself to shine the spotlight on the open source community and highlight some lesser-known open source Swift projects.

### News and community

Ole Begemann was kind enough to [write up part of Chris Lattner's commentary](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/06/chris-lattner-wwdc-swift-panel/) from the [WWDC Swift Panel](https://news.realm.io/news/wwdc-2017-swift-panel/) a few weeks ago. Swift's long-term plan is exciting! You can read the [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14673059) for even more commentary and discussion.

Ben Scheirman [wrote a great post](http://benscheirman.com/2017/06/ultimate-guide-to-json-parsing-with-swift-4/) that looks at Swift's new Encoder/Decoder implementation, focusing on JSON parsing.

Simon Gladman's [Core Image for Swift](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/book/core-image-for-swift/id1073029980?mt=13) book is [now free](https://twitter.com/flexmonkey/status/881789384735039489)! 👍

[Chris Eidhof](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) wrote a [post](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/reducers/) where he refactors an asynchronous view controller using the reducer pattern.

LLVM's bug tracker now has a ["beginner"](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2017-June/114845.html) keyword. If you're a new contributor to LLVM, it's easier than ever to find and tackle these more beginner-level bugs. The Swift compiler uses a great deal of LLVM's functionality, so contributing to LLVM helps Swift too!

### Commits and pull requests

Erica Sadun [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/729) introducing the Unwrap-or-Die operator. Swift could be safer than ever before.

### Proposals

No updates on proposals this week! As always, you can [check the status page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) for details.
