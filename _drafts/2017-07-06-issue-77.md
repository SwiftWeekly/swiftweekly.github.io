### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 18: Community Open Source Spotlight](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/72298), {episode description}

### News and community

Ben Scheirman [wrote a really good post](http://benscheirman.com/2017/06/ultimate-guide-to-json-parsing-with-swift-4/) that looks at new Encoder/Decoder implementation, focusing on JSON parsing. 

Good [article](https://medium.com/@cossacklabs/apple-export-regulations-on-crypto-6306380682e1) to read about how it's needed to submit your app with encryption to App Store

Simon's [Core Image for Swift book](https://twitter.com/flexmonkey/status/881789384735039489) is free now👍🏻!

[Chris Eidhof](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) wrote a [post][http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/reducers/] where he refactors an asynchronous view controller using reducers pattern.

LLVM's bug tracker now has a ["beginner"](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2017-June/114845.html) keyword. It might be easier for newcomers to start contributing into LLVM looking for "begginer"'s bugs to do. With contribution to LLVM you helps Swift too!

### Commits and pull requests

Erica Sadun [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/729) with introduction of the Unwrap-or-Die operator. Swift could be more safely than even before🍎
