### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 53](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/130955) Jesse and JP discuss Swift for Tensorflow, which was announced in a talk by Chris Lattner at TensorFlow Dev Summit 2019.

In [Episode 54]() [..]

### News and community

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) wrote [a blog post](https://medium.com/@slavapestov/behind-the-scenes-improvements-in-swift-4-1-269dd56e30c2) on some of the less-visible improvements in Swift 4.1.

### Commits and pull requests

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://github.com/xedin) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15843) that makes progresson fully implementing [SE-0110](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0110-distingish-single-tuple-arg.md): *Distinguish between	single-tuple and multiple-argument function types*.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15894) to improve the Swift Intermediate Language ([SIL](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/SIL.rst))'s deserialization in `-Onone` mode — by 25% on a large project with badge mode! 👏

### Accepted proposals

SE-0208

### Extended proposals

The review of [SE-0202](): ** was [extended](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0202-random-unification/11313/149) to get feedback on its design.

> The nature of the generator API implies that the generators must be reference-y, since they aren’t passed inout to functions like `shuffle`, but aren’t *required* to be reference types.
>
> The team thinks making the `random(in: Range<T>)` family free functions, rather than static methods on `T`, may help with discoverability.
>
> The team felt that `Collection.randomElement` would work better than `Collection.random`. Unlike `.first` or `.max`, the word “random” doesn’t noun well, so adding “Element” improves readability.
>
> The core team believes it would be better to leave implementation details of the default source to the individual platforms, rather than defining the implementation for each platform as part of the proposal.

### Swift Forums

[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) shared [initial core team review notes](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0206-hashable-enhancements/11675/104) on [SE-0206](): **.

> [..] `init(seed😃`'s behavior may be misleading to users who expect it to enable deterministic hashing, and has no real benefit over a collection implementation seeding the hasher directly with combine calls.
>
> As a further simplification, the core team observes that the many `combine(bits😃` overloads on `Hasher` that take fixed-sized integers don’t need to be public API. Instead, they can be `@usableFromInline` entry points invoked by `@inlinable` implementations of `hash(into😃` on the integer types themselves.
