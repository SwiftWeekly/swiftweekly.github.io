### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 53](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/130955) Jesse and JP discuss Swift for Tensorflow, which was announced in a talk by Chris Lattner at TensorFlow Dev Summit 2019.

In [Episode 54]() [..]

### News and community

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) wrote [a blog post](https://medium.com/@slavapestov/behind-the-scenes-improvements-in-swift-4-1-269dd56e30c2) on some of the less-visible improvements in Swift 4.1.

[Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache) wrote [a blog post](https://modocache.io/swift-compiler-diagnostics-part-1) on how the Swift compiler emits diagnostics.

### Commits and pull requests

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://github.com/xedin) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15843) that makes progresson fully implementing [SE-0110](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0110-distingish-single-tuple-arg.md): *Distinguish between	single-tuple and multiple-argument function types*.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15894) to improve the Swift Intermediate Language ([SIL](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/SIL.rst))'s deserialization in `-Onone` mode — by 25% on a large project with badge mode! 👏

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0201](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0201-package-manager-local-dependencies.md): *Package Manager Local Dependencies* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0201-package-manager-local-dependencies/11286/17).

> Feedback was positive, and the proposal is accepted. Thanks to everyone who participated!

[SE-0208](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0208-package-manager-system-library-targets.md): *Package Manager System Library Targets* was [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0208-package-manager-system-library-targets/11735) and consequently [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0208-package-manager-system-library-targets/11735/16).

> This proposal introduces a new type of target "system library target", which moves the current system-module packages feature from package to target level.
>
> The package manager currently supports "system-module packages" which are intended to adapt a system installed dependency to work with the package manager. However, this feature is only supported on package declarations, which mean libraries that need it often need to create a separate repository containing the system package and refer to it as a dependency.
>
> Our original motivation in forcing system packages to be declared as standalone packages was to encourage the ecosystem to standardize on them, their names, their repository locations, and their owners. In practice, this effort did not work out and it only made the package manager harder to use.

### Extended proposals

The review of [SE-0202](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0202-random-unification.md): *Random Unification* was [extended](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0202-random-unification/11313/149) to get feedback on its design.

> The nature of the generator API implies that the generators must be reference-y, since they aren’t passed inout to functions like `shuffle`, but aren’t *required* to be reference types.
>
> The team thinks making the `random(in: Range<T>)` family free functions, rather than static methods on `T`, may help with discoverability.
>
> The team felt that `Collection.randomElement` would work better than `Collection.random`. Unlike `.first` or `.max`, the word “random” doesn’t noun well, so adding “Element” improves readability.
>
> The core team believes it would be better to leave implementation details of the default source to the individual platforms, rather than defining the implementation for each platform as part of the proposal.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0209](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0209-package-manager-swift-lang-version-update.md): *Package Manager Swift Language Version API Update* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0209-package-manager-swift-language-version-api-update/11815).

> This proposal changes the current `Package.swift` manifest API for declaring for Swift language versions from freeform Integer array to a new `SwiftVersion` enum array.
>
> The Swift compiler now allows `4.2` as an accepted value of Swift version flag (`-swift-version`). The `swiftLanguageVersions` API in `Package.swift` currently accepts an interger array and we need to update this API in order for packages to declare this language version if required.

### Swift Forums

[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) shared [initial core team review notes](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0206-hashable-enhancements/11675/104) on [SE-0206](): **.

> [..] `init(seed😃`'s behavior may be misleading to users who expect it to enable deterministic hashing, and has no real benefit over a collection implementation seeding the hasher directly with combine calls.
>
> As a further simplification, the core team observes that the many `combine(bits😃` overloads on `Hasher` that take fixed-sized integers don’t need to be public API. Instead, they can be `@usableFromInline` entry points invoked by `@inlinable` implementations of `hash(into😃` on the integer types themselves.
