### Podcasts

In [episode 92](https://swiftbysundell.com/podcast/92/) of the Swift by Sundell podcast, [Kaitlin Mahar](https://twitter.com/k__mahar) joins [John](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) to discuss the current state of server-side Swift, designing APIs for server-side libraries, and Swift’s upcoming suite of structured concurrency features.

### News and community

[Adam Fowler](https://twitter.com/o_aberration) wrote a [blog post](https://opticalaberration.com/2021/02/hummingbird.html) about [Hummingbird](https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird): A Swift HTTP server framework. Hummingbird is a lightweight, flexible server framework. It is split into three section. HummingbirdCore: the HTTP server, Hummingbird: the web application framework and finally the extension modules.

[Dave DeLong](https://twitter.com/davedelong) wrote [a great article](https://davedelong.com/blog/2021/03/04/exploiting-string-interpolation-for-fun-and-for-profit/) talking about exploiting String interpolation for fun and for profit.

[Tibor Bödecs](https://twitter.com/tiborbodecs) wrote [an article](https://theswiftdev.com/memory-layout-in-swift/) explaining memory layout in Swift.

### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/36109) that adds a new algorithm for identifying redundant non-same-type requirements.

[Kavon Farvardin](https://twitter.com/call1cc) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/35965) that allows `get` access to properties from outside the actor.

[Victor Guerra](https://twitter.com/vguerra) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/36128) that improves diagnostic for when the registered derivative function.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0299](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0299-second-review-extending-static-member-lookup-in-generic-contexts/44565): *Extending Static Member Lookup in Generic Contexts* was [accepted with modifications](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modification-se-0299-extending-static-member-lookup-in-generic-contexts/45238).

> The second review period for [SE-0299: Extending Static Member Lookup in Generic Contexts](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0299-second-review-extending-static-member-lookup-in-generic-contexts/44565) has concluded. The core team has decided to **accept** this revision proposal, with one more modification suggested by John McCall:

> I'm somewhat happy with the new restriction requiring a `Self` constraint, but I'm worried that making that unconditional is going to be unnecessarily limiting on the case where you're just building a value of protocol type. Or does that not work because we don't know what to bind `Self` to?
>
> I would suggest the rule that the variable type / function return type should be required to be a subtype of the `Self` type.

### Returned proposals

[SE-0302](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0302-concurrent-value-and-concurrent-closures.md) has been [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0302-concurrentvalue-and-concurrent-closures/45251).

> SE-0302 is **accepted** in its basic approach.  It will be revised according to the above decisions, and the community will have an opportunity to review the result shortly.  We ask that reviewers focus on just the changed aspects of the proposal, unless they feel that something important was missed in the first review.

### Rejected proposals

### Proposals in review

[SE-0295](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0295-codable-synthesis-for-enums-with-associated-values.md): *Codable synthesis for enums with associated values* is [under a third review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0295-codable-synthesis-for-enums-with-associated-values-third-review/45190).

> For the third review, the goal is not to re-litigate the entire proposal, but to focus on reviewing the additional details around the schema evolution.  The updates for handling of certain overloaded enums and the choice to exclude certain enums from auto-synthesis due to evolution restrictions as specified in the proposal are also in scope.

[SE-0302](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0302-concurrent-value-and-concurrent-closures.md): *Sendable and sendable closures* is [under a second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0302-second-review-sendable-and-sendable-closures/45253).

> This is a narrow re-review, and reviewers should focus on the changes made in the first revision, which are described in the [announcement post 60](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0302-concurrentvalue-and-concurrent-closures/45251).  To briefly summarize them:
>
> * The `@concurrent` function attribute is now named `@sendable`.
> * The `ConcurrentValue` protocol is now named `Sendable`.
> * The `UnsafeConcurrentValue` protocol no longer exists, but `Sendable` conformances may be explicitly decorated with `@unchecked`, e.g.
>
>    ```swift
>    class MyClass: @unchecked Sendable {}
>    ```
>
> * Non-`public` `struct` and `enum` types now implicitly conform to `Sendable` if their stored properties and  case payloads all conform.

[SE-0300](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0300-continuation.md): *Continuations for interfacing async tasks with synchronous code* is [under a third review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0300-third-review-continuations-for-interfacing-async-tasks-with-synchronous-code/45245).

> Following the [second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0300-second-review-continuations-for-interfacing-async-tasks-with-synchronous-code/) of this proposal, the core team feels that the proposal is close to acceptance, and is an important feature as part of Swift's concurrency roadmap. However, a small number of amendments have been made based on feedback during the second review.
>
> * Replaced separate `*Continuation<T>` and `*ThrowingContinuation<T>` types with a single `Continuation<T, E: Error>` type parameterized on the error type.
> * Added a convenience `resume()` equivalent to `resume(returning: ())` for continuations with a `Void` return type.
> * Changed `with*ThrowingContinuation` to take an `operation` block that may throw, and to immediately resume the task throwing the error if an uncaught error propagates from the operation

[SE-0304](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0304-structured-concurrency.md): *Structured Concurrency* is [under a review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0304-structured-concurrency/45314).

> [`async`/`await`](https://github.com/DougGregor/swift-evolution/blob/async-await/proposals/nnnn-async-await.md) is a language mechanism for writing natural, efficient asynchronous code. Asynchronous functions (introduced with `async`) can give up the thread on which they are executing at any given suspension point (marked with `await`), which is necessary for building highly-concurrent systems.
>
> However, the `async`/`await` proposal does not introduce concurrency _per se_: ignoring the suspension points within an asynchronous function, it will execute in essentially the same manner as a synchronous function. This proposal introduces support for [structured concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency) in Swift, enabling concurrent execution of asynchronous code with a model that is ergonomic, predictable, and admits efficient implementation.

### Swift Forums

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) [updated](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-4-actors/45215) us about revies [actor proposal](https://github.com/DougGregor/swift-evolution/blob/actors/proposals/nnnn-actors.md).

> * Allow cross-actor references to actor properties, so long as they are reads (not writes or inout references)
Added isolated parameters, to generalize the previously-special behavior of self in an actor and make the semantics of nonisolated more clear.
> * Limit nonisolated(unsafe) to stored instance properties. The prior definition was far too broad.
> * Clarify that super is isolated if self is.
> * Prohibit references to actor-isolated declarations in key paths.
> * Clarify the behavior of partial applications.
> * Added a "future directions" section describing isolated protocol conformances.

[James Sherlock](https://forums.swift.org/u/sherlouk) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-swift-package-access-control/45174) for how the Swift language could be evolved to add a new access control keyword designed for use in Swift Packages.

> Swift currently has a handful of access control modifiers, namely: `open public internal private fileprivate`. These keywords change the visibility of parts of our code to change what other parts of our codebase have access to said code.
> 
> Swift Packages define targets which are groups of code. Targets can depend on other targets, and multiple targets can be combined to create a product. A product can be a dependency of another application or package.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) started [a discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/formalizing-swift-generics-as-a-term-rewriting-system/45175) about formalizing Swift generics as a term rewriting system.

> Previously I wrote about how the full generality of [the Swift generic system is undecidable](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-type-checking-is-undecidable/39024). The basic idea is that "finitely-presented monoids" can be written as a Swift protocol where the "word problem" on the monoid reduces to proving an equivalence between two types. Since the word problem is known to be undecidable, this shows that Swift generics (as currently defined) are undecidable.

[Tim Condon](https://twitter.com/0xTim) pitched the [MultipartKit](https://github.com/vapor/multipart-kit) to the SSWG. MultipartKit is a Swift library for encoding and decoding multipart form data based on SwiftNIO. It contains a C library used for the actual parsing of the request data and a Swift wrapper to integrate the C library with SwiftNIO.

> Multipart is a popular mechanism for sending data to servers, especially when doing file uploads. It's supported by both browsers and HTTP libraries and we feel that having a Swift implementation in the SSWG is an important step for the ecosystem.
>
> MultipartKit was originally built into Vapor for the release of Vapor 4 with the intention of splitting it out at a later date and pitching it to the SSWG so here we are! Since the implementation has been used in Vapor 4 it's fairly well battle tested and deployed.

[Tom Doron](https://twitter.com/TomerDoron) posted the Swift on the Server Workgroup [Jan 20th, 2020 meeting](https://forums.swift.org/t/jan-20th-2020/45276) notes.

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://twitter.com/pyaskevich) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-allow-interchangeable-use-of-cgfloat-and-double-types/45324) to allow interchangeable use of `CGFloat` and `Double` types.

> When Swift was first released, the type of `CGFloat` presented a challenge. At the time, most iOS devices were still 32-bit. SDKs such as CoreGraphics provided APIs that took 32-bit floating point values on 32-bit platforms, and 64-bit values on 64-bit platforms. When these APIs were first introduced, 32-bit scalar arithmetic was faster on 32-bit platforms, but by the time of Swift’s release, this was no longer true: then, as today, 64-bit scalar arithmetic was just as fast as 32-bit even on 32-bit platforms (albeit with higher memory overhead). But the 32/64-bit split remained, mostly for source and ABI stability reasons.

[Tim Vermeulen](https://twitter.com/tim_vermeulen) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-efficient-collection-startindex-throughout-the-standard-library/45317) about efficient `Collection.startIndex` throughout the standard library.

> `Collection.startIndex` is [expected](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/stdlib/public/core/Collection.swift#L322-L329) to be an O(1) operation, but some collections in the standard library deviate from this, which can lead to unpredictable performance. We should change these collections to properly meet this O(1) performance expectation, by doing any expensive work needed to reach the first element ahead of time, in the collection’s initializer.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) informed about revised [Actors](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-6-actors/45519) proposal.

> After yet more interesting discussion in [pitch #4 (and 5)](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-4-actors/45215), we've revised the [actor proposal](https://github.com/DougGregor/swift-evolution/blob/actors/proposals/nnnn-actors.md) for this, pitch \#6, addressing more feedback.
>
> Changes in the sixth pitch:
>
> * Make the instance requirements of `Actor` protocols actor-isolated to `self` , and allow actor types to conform to such protocols using actor-isolated witnesses.
> * Reflow the "Proposed Solution" section to get the bigger ideas out earlier.
> * Remove `nonisolated(unsafe)`.

Gwendal Roué pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-scoped-functions/45486) about introducing scoped functions.

> Scoped Functions are functions that enhance the leading dot syntax inside their body, so that it gives short-hand access to the members of a specific value. Such functions exist so that API designers and their consumers can collaborate towards a way to write focused code where an agreed implicit and obvious context does not have to be spelled out.
