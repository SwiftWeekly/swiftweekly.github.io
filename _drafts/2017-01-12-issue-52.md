- [SR-3419](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3419): [Starter Proposal] Strides should be collections
- [SR-888](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-888): [Starter Proposal] `Sequence.minElement()` and `maxElement()` should be protocol requirements (customization points)

### Commits and pull requests

Ben Ng ([@ben-ng](https://github.com/ben-ng)) send a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6653) to add a benchmark for `+=` when appending to an `Array`. This is to measure the impact of his [other pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6652) that improves the performance of appending to `Array` with `+=`.

Russell Currey ([@russelldotcc](https://twitter.com/russelldotcc)) merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/767) to corelibs-foundation to enable building on PowerPC.

Maxim Moiseev ([@moiseev](https://twitter.com/moiseev)) opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6603) to deprecate `+` and `-` for `SignedInteger` and its Stride. This allowed for mixed-type arithmetic, which is not supposed to work. It was necessary prior to the new [collection indexing model](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0065-collections-move-indices.md) to make moving indexes simple. This is a breaking change that will be allowed (with a warning) under Swift 3.1 and an error in Swift 4.

### Accepted proposals

Proposal [SE-0147](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0147-move-unsafe-initialize-from.md): *Move `UnsafeMutablePointer.initialize(from:)` to `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`* by Ben Cohen was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-January/000305.html).

> Feedback was light but positive, and the proposal is accepted for Swift 4. Thanks to everyone who participated!

### Mailing lists

Alex Martini [sent out an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170102/029962.html) on design discussion for upcoming proposals:

> To help keep proposals moving forward, the Swift core team has set aside some time specifically for design discussions of upcoming proposals.  Below are some rough notes from the discussion this week.
>
> These are informal comments, intended to guide the proposals in directions that draw constructive feedback. You are welcome to ignore the feedback, agree with it, or disagree with it.  As always, the formal decision doesn't happen until after the review period ends.

The email goes on to mostly discuss details about Doug Gregor's [draft proposal](https://github.com/DougGregor/swift-evolution/blob/objc-inference/proposals/NNNN-objc-inference.md), *Limiting @objc inference*.
