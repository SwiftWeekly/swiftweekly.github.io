This week brough some very unexpected and somewhat saddening news. As you've likely heard, Chris Lattner [will be leaving Apple](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170109/030063.html) to pursue other opportunities. (More on this below.) While the timing certainly seems abrupt, these things rarely happen "at a good time."

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-3542](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3542): [Starter Proposal] `enum` cases should have compound names, like functions
- [SR-3419](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3419): [Starter Proposal] Strides should be collections
- [SR-888](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-888): [Starter Proposal] `Sequence.minElement()` and `maxElement()` should be protocol requirements (customization points)

### News and community

[DotSwift](https://www.dotswift.io), *the European Swift Conference*, will be held 27 January, 2017 in Paris, France. *Swift Weekly Brief* readers can get a **20% discount** on tickets with the code **SWIFTWEEKLYBRIEF** ([direct link](https://dotswift2017.eventbrite.com/?discount=SWIFTWEEKLYBRIEF)).

### Commits and pull requests

Ben Ng ([@ben-ng](https://github.com/ben-ng)) send a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6653) to add a benchmark for `+=` when appending to an `Array`. This is to measure the impact of his [other pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6652) that improves the performance of appending to `Array` with `+=`.

Russell Currey ([@russelldotcc](https://twitter.com/russelldotcc)) merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/767) to corelibs-foundation to enable building on PowerPC.

Maxim Moiseev ([@moiseev](https://twitter.com/moiseev)) opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6603) to deprecate `+` and `-` for `SignedInteger` and its Stride. This allowed for mixed-type arithmetic, which is not supposed to work. It was necessary prior to the new [collection indexing model](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0065-collections-move-indices.md) to make moving indexes simple. This is a breaking change that will be allowed (with a warning) under Swift 3.1 and an error in Swift 4.

### Accepted proposals

Proposal [SE-0147](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0147-move-unsafe-initialize-from.md): *Move `UnsafeMutablePointer.initialize(from:)` to `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`* by Ben Cohen was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-January/000305.html).

> Feedback was light but positive, and the proposal is accepted for Swift 4. Thanks to everyone who participated!

### Mailing lists

As mentioned above, Chris Lattner [sent an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170109/030063.html) this week about leaving Apple and transfering his responsibilities to Ted Kremenek:

> Since Apple launched Swift at WWDC 2014, the Swift team has worked closely with our developer community.  When we made Swift open source and launched Swift.org we put a lot of effort into defining a strong community structure.  This structure has enabled Apple and the amazingly vibrant Swift community to work together to evolve Swift into a powerful, mature language powering software used by hundreds of millions of people.
> 
> I’m happy to announce that Ted Kremenek will be taking over for me as “Project Lead” for the Swift project, managing the administrative and leadership responsibility for Swift.org.  This recognizes the incredible effort he has already been putting into the project, and reflects a decision I’ve made to leave Apple later this month to pursue an opportunity in another space.  This decision wasn't made lightly, and I want you all to know that I’m still completely committed to Swift.  I plan to remain an active member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the swift-evolution mailing list.
> 
> Working with many phenomenal teams at Apple to launch Swift has been a unique life experience.  Apple is a truly amazing place to be able to assemble the skills, imagination, and discipline to pull something like this off.  Swift is in great shape today, and Swift 4 will be a really strong release with Ted as the Project Lead. 
>
> Note that this isn’t a change to the structure - just to who sits in which role - so we don’t expect it to impact day-to-day operations in the Swift Core Team in any significant way.  Ted and I wanted to let you know what is happening as a part of our commitment to keeping the structure of Swift.org transparent to our community.

Alex Martini [sent out an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170102/029962.html) on design discussion for upcoming proposals:

> To help keep proposals moving forward, the Swift core team has set aside some time specifically for design discussions of upcoming proposals.  Below are some rough notes from the discussion this week.
>
> These are informal comments, intended to guide the proposals in directions that draw constructive feedback. You are welcome to ignore the feedback, agree with it, or disagree with it.  As always, the formal decision doesn't happen until after the review period ends.

The email goes on to mostly discuss details about Doug Gregor's [draft proposal](https://github.com/DougGregor/swift-evolution/blob/objc-inference/proposals/NNNN-objc-inference.md), *Limiting @objc inference*.
