### Podcasts

In [episode 84 of Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/316012), [Jesse](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires) and [JP](https://twitter.com/simjp) discuss about Swift in 2020.

### News and community

[Cory Benfield](https://twitter.com/Lukasaoz) released [Swift Crypto](https://github.com/apple/swift-crypto) on the [dotSwift](https://www.dotswift.io/) conference [stage](https://twitter.com/NicoonGuitar/status/1224376366092767233). He wrote an [article](https://swift.org/blog/crypto/) on Swift.org website. As well some folks started a [discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/native-implementations-and-boringssl-backed-apple-platform-deployments/33404).

> Swift Crypto is a new Swift package that brings the fantastic APIs of [Apple CryptoKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cryptokit) to the wider Swift community. This will allow Swift developers, regardless of the platform on which they deploy their applications, to access these APIs for a common set of cryptographic operations.

Release of Swift 5.1.4 for Linux has been [announced](https://forums.swift.org/t/announcing-swift-5-1-4-for-linux/33443). New downloads are available on [swift.org](https://swift.org/download/#swift-514). Official Docker images are also available.

[Ole Begemann](https://twitter.com/olebegemann) wrote two great articles. [First one](https://oleb.net/2020/swift-test-discovery/) is about automatic test discovery in Swift on Linux. In [second one](https://oleb.net/2020/swift-docker-linux/) he talks about how to test Swift packages on Linux using Docker.

[John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) wrote an [article](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/slicing-swift-collections/) explaining slicing Swift collections.

[Antoine van der Lee](https://twitter.com/twannl) explaining in his [blog post](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/creating-swift-package-manager-framework/) how to create Swift Package framework in Xcode.

[Point-Free](https://twitter.com/pointfreeco) folks [announced](https://twitter.com/pointfreeco/status/1224742851537514497) a library called [CasePaths](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths) that brings the power and ergonomics of key paths to enums.

### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/29579) that fixes `computeSelfParam()` to respect `__consuming` on class methods.

He also [tweeted](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/1223394327340019717):

> Dodged an ABI bullet here. Underscored keyword was broken... but thankfully the broken case wasnâ€™t exercised in the standard library

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/26975) where he and [CodaFi](https://twitter.com/CodaFi_) were able to fix the remaining cases where name lookup in imported types would force loading `_all_` the members of a type or extension in order to find a `_single_` member.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0270](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0270-rangeset-and-collection-operations.md): *Add Collection Operations on Noncontiguous Elements* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0270-add-collection-operations-on-noncontiguous-elements/33270). Although some [discussions](https://forums.swift.org/t/evolution-process-discussion/33272) started about that.

> We can use a `Range<Index>` to refer to a group of consecutive positions in a collection, but the standard library doesn't currently provide a way to refer to discontiguous positions in an arbitrary collection. I propose the addition of a `RangeSet` type that can represent any number of positions, along with collection algorithms that operate on those positions.

### Swift Forums

[Tino](https://forums.swift.org/u/Tino) started an interesting [discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/jargon-acronyms-vs-accessible-language/33358) about Jargon & acronyms vs. accessible language.

> When it comes to naming, I think it's best to keep the majority in mind, and not trying to please a very small group by preferring their jargon. An expert may prefer his wording, but would certainly also understand common language easily.

### Finally

Should Swift library [include](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires/status/1224456344792530949) a lot of Swift code? ðŸ¤”

Small [change](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/77da6bd3a7c3c2ec02bb0f13e7341cf867cab0d3), but big [impact](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/1224537246998487040). ðŸ™ƒ
