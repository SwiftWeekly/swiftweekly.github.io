With build time improvements in Swift 9.3, the 🏎 once again [proves its existence](https://twitter.com/cabel/status/793886373849608192).

> TODO

Greetings! Long time no see. Past two weeks pleased us with interesting updates about proposals, new Apple's NIO project and updates on Swift 4.2 release process. Enjoy the issue!

### Swift Unwrapped

In [episode 48](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/117689), Jesse and JP discuss the Google Summer Of Code 2018 and Swift's participation in the project. In [episode 49](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/117707), they discuss [Dave DeLong](https://twitter.com/davedelong)'s Swift Protocol Wishlist, looking at the possibilities of Swift Protocols without  boundaries.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0198](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0198-playground-quicklook-api-revamp.md): *Playground QuickLook API Revamp* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0198-playground-quicklook-api-revamp/9448/16) with a minor revision.

> The new API for customizing playground display will be adopted, and the previous API deprecated, as described in the proposal. However, the new protocol will remain part of the standard library rather than moving to the playground support library, in order to facilitate frameworks that want to ship with built-in custom playground display capability.

### Swift Forums

Jordan Rose [shared](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0192-non-exhaustive-enums/7291/337) an update on [SE-0192](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0192-non-exhaustive-enums.md):

> Over the last few weeks I’ve been discussing this with the core team, who pretty much all agreed that **this is not the right direction for third-party libraries.**
>
> I’m working on cutting down the proposal text (and the implementation) to match this feedback from the core team.

### Finally

Did you know that `enum` was once called [`oneof`](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/970857272724172800) — and [`union`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2013-09-24)?
