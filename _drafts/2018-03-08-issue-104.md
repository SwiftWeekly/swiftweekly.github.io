With build time improvements in Swift 9.3, the 🏎 once again [proves its existence](https://twitter.com/cabel/status/793886373849608192).

> TODO

Greetings! Long time no see. Past two weeks pleased us with interesting updates about proposals, new Apple's NIO project and updates on Swift 4.2 release process. Enjoy the issue!

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-7083](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7083) [Compiler] `lazy` properties can't have observers
- [SR-7053](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7053) [Package Manager] SwiftPM command line autocompletion script for `zsh` produces error: "invalid option definition:…" on completion
- [SR-7015](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7015) [Compiler] The CoreFoundation conditional downcast diagnostic is not as helpful as it should be
- [SR-6982](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6982) [Compiler] Improve internal compiler consistency
- [SR-6979](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6979) [Compiler] `thin_to_thick_function` derived pointers do not need to be retained/released
- [SR-6960](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6960) [Standard Library] Floating-point `nextUp` and `nextDown` are unnecessarily slow for concrete types
- [SR-6889](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6889) [Compiler] Use `ArgMemOnly` for runtime functions
- [SR-6789](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6789) [Foundation] `IndexPath` needs benchmarks

### Swift Unwrapped

In [episode 48](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/117689), Jesse and JP discuss the Google Summer Of Code 2018 and Swift's participation in the project. In [episode 49](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/117707), they discuss [Dave DeLong](https://twitter.com/davedelong)'s Swift Protocol Wishlist, looking at the possibilities of Swift Protocols without  boundaries.

### News and community

Apple [released](https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_9.3_beta_4/Release_Notes_for_Xcode_9.3_beta_4.pdf) Xcode 9.3 beta 4. Erica Sadun [wrote](http://ericasadun.com/2018/03/05/new-to-swift-in-xcode-9-3-beta-4-se-0075-and-se-0190-allow-better-configuration-testing/) about some of the included Swift changes (`canImport` and `targetEnvironment`).

Ted Kremenek [announced](https://swift.org/blog/4-2-release-process/) Swift 4.2 and its planned relase process. Swift 4.2 "is meant to be a waypoint towards achieving ABI stability in Swift 5 [..] as well as have a goal of some focused improvements on compile-time performance". 🎉

Jordan Rose [wrote](http://belkadan.com/blog/2018/02/Many-to-Many-Protocols/) a blog post exploring types with multiple `RawValue`s.

Ben Asher [shared](https://twitter.com/benasher44/status/968905975724892160) their clean build times (with the "old" build system) decreas by 4 minutes compared to Swift 9.2; from 11 minutes to 7 minutes, that's a 36% speedup!

Alfredo Delli Bovi [shared](https://twitter.com/adellibovi/status/969012500682477568) similar results, going from 7 and a half minutes to 5. 🏎

At try! Swift, Norman Maurer introduced [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio), "a cross-platform asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients".
Interesting to note is that they are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/issues); no JIRA!

Vapor then [integrated](https://twitter.com/codevapor/status/970012673852178432) with SwiftNIO mere days after the announcement. They were able to delete nearly 15.000 lines of code! 😮

Marcin Krzyżanowski [wrote](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/first-class-swift-api-for-objective-c-frameworks/) how they created a first-class Swift API for an Objective-C framework, using all the amazing bridging and attributes available.

### Commits and pull requests

[Reid Kleckner](https://github.com/rnk) pushed a [commit](https://github.com/apple/swift-clang/commit/334f080ab3c1bfbb13601a4f404b9c97e2294eb9) that fixes a variant of the [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf) vulnerability.

[Karoy Lorentey](https://github.com/lorentey) worked on a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/14913) to use SipHash-1-3 for all hashing.

> This PR intends to improve matters by standardizing on a high quality hash function, SipHash, for use inside the standard library and inside compiler-synthesized Hashable implementations. (SipHash is already implemented in the stdlib, but so far it has been sitting there largely unused.)
>
> This PR does not introduce public API to help with manual Hashable implementations -- but it provides the first step towards providing one.

[Harlan](https://github.com/harlanhaskins) created a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/14854) that makes SwiftSyntax build on Linux.

[Michael Ilseman](https://github.com/milseman) worked on a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/14755) could speedup ObjC bridging 2.5 times.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0198](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0198-playground-quicklook-api-revamp.md): *Playground QuickLook API Revamp* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0198-playground-quicklook-api-revamp/9448/16) with a minor revision.

> The new API for customizing playground display will be adopted, and the previous API deprecated, as described in the proposal. However, the new protocol will remain part of the standard library rather than moving to the playground support library, in order to facilitate frameworks that want to ship with built-in custom playground display capability.

[SE-0199](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0199-bool-toggle.md): *Adding toggle to Bool* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-199-add-toggle-to-bool/10681).

> The review of SE-199 has ended, and the proposal has been accepted as-is. There was some discussion during the review of alternative names, but the team felt that toggle was the best one offered.

### Swift Forums

Jordan Rose [shared](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0192-non-exhaustive-enums/7291/337) an update on [SE-0192](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0192-non-exhaustive-enums.md):

> Over the last few weeks I’ve been discussing this with the core team, who pretty much all agreed that **this is not the right direction for third-party libraries.**
>
> I’m working on cutting down the proposal text (and the implementation) to match this feedback from the core team.

### Finally

Did you know that `enum` was once called [`oneof`](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/970857272724172800) — and [`union`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2013-09-24)?
