### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 5: [Objective-C Interoperability](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/61854)

There's been a much stronger focus on calling Objective-C from Swift than the other way around, but in episode talk we'll cover both directions and the parts of the Swift language involved in the process.

### News and community

JP Simard [noticed](https://twitter.com/simjp/status/848288462952316928) references to "rename" actions in [SourceKit](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/master/tools/SourceKit) in Xcode 8.3, and predicted we'll see refactoring support for Swift in Xcode 9. He also [pointed out](https://twitter.com/simjp/status/848288609006309376) that the "Swift Syntax Structured Editing Library" that [was announced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170206/004066.html) a couple of months ago is an even bigger indication of refactoring support. If true, this would be a huge relief for developers. This is something I've wanted from Xcode for years (!) now. Let's hope we see this at WWDC in a few months!

Speaking of JP Simard, he released [SourceKitten 0.17.1](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten/releases/tag/0.17.1), which includes Swift 3.1 support.

### Rejected proposals

[SE-0159](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0159-fix-private-access-levels.md): *Fix Private Access Levels* was [rejected](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-April/000337.html).

> The core team had a lengthy discussion of this proposal as well as related ideas that came up during (and prior to) the review.
>
> [SE-0159](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0159-fix-private-access-levels.md) specifically sought to revert the main user-facing part of [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md), which gave `private` lexical-scoping semantics and introduced `fileprivate`. The core team felt that there was sufficient evidence that more-restrictive-than-fileprivate access control is in use within the Swift community and in established patterns, such that it would be harmful to remove the functionality introduced by [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md) at this point.
>
> The core team discussed the idea of renaming to keywords that was brought up in the thread as a way to address many of the concerns raised in [SE-0159](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0159-fix-private-access-levels.md) while providing the same language semantics. Specifically:
>
> * `private` -> `scoped`
> * `fileprivate` -> `private`
>
> The core team determined that such a change, while (technically) easy to automatically migrate, would introduce far too much churn in Swift code bases moving from Swift 3 to Swift 4, compromising the source stability goals set out for Swift 4.
>
> Finally, the core team discussed a different potential design for “private” that admits a limited form of type-based access control within files. We will open a separate discussion thread on Swift Evolution, with the subject "Type-based 'private' access within a file", and are seeking further discussion there and a motivated volunteer to turn it into a new proposal for Swift 4.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0155](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0155-normalize-enum-case-representation.md): *Normalize Enum Case Representation* by Daniel Duan and Joe Groff is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-March/000336.html).

> In Swift 3, associated values of an enum case are represented by a tuple. This implementation causes inconsistencies in case declaration, construction and pattern matching in several places.
>
> Enums, therefore, can be made more "regular" when we replace tuple as the representation of associated case values. This proposal aims to define the effect of doings so on various parts of the language.
>
> Swift-evolution thread: [Normalize Enum Case Representation (rev. 2)](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170306/033626.html)

[SE-0161](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0161-key-paths.md): *Smart KeyPaths: Better Key-Value Coding for Swift* by David Smith, Michael LeHew, and Joe Groff is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-March/000334.html).

> We propose a family of concrete _Key Path_ types that represent uninvoked references to properties that can be composed to form paths through many values and directly get/set their underlying values.
>
> **We Can Do Better than String**<br/>
> On Darwin platforms Swift's existing `#keyPath()` syntax provides a convenient way to safely *refer* to properties. Unfortunately, once validated, the expression becomes a `String` which has a number of important limitations:
>
> * Loss of type information (requiring awkward `Any` APIs)
> * Unnecessarily slow to parse
> * Only applicable to `NSObjects`
> * Limited to Darwin platforms
>
> **Use/Mention Distinctions**<br/>
> While methods can be referred to without invoking them (`let x = foo.bar` instead of  `let x = foo.bar()`), this is not currently possible for properties and subscripts. Making indirect references to a properties' concrete types also lets us expose metadata about the property, and in the future additional behaviors.
>
> **More Expressive KeyPaths**<br/>
> We would also like to support being able to use _Key Paths_ to access into collections, which is not currently possible.

[SE-0162](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0162-package-manager-custom-target-layouts.md): *Package Manager Custom Target Layouts* by Ankit Aggarwal is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170403/034997.html).

> This proposal enhances the `Package.swift` manifest APIs to support custom target layouts, and removes a convention which allowed omission of targets from the manifest.
>
> The Package Manager uses a convention system to infer targets structure from disk layout. This works well for most packages, which can easily adopt the conventions, and frees users from needing to update their `Package.swift` file every time they add or remove sources. Adopting the conventions is more difficult for some packages, however – especially existing C libraries or large projects, which would be difficult to reorganize. We intend to give users a way to make such projects into packages without needing to conform to our conventions.
>
> The current convention rules make it very convenient to add new targets and source files by inferring them automatically from disk, but they also can be confusing, overly-implicit, and difficult to debug; for example, if the user does not follow the conventions correctly which determine their targets, they may wind up with targets they don't expect, or not having targets they did expect, and either way their clients can't easily see which targets are available by looking at the `Package.swift` manifest. We want to retain convenience where it really matters, such as easy addition of new source files, but require explicit declarations where being explicit adds significant value. We also want to make sure that the implicit conventions we keep are straightforward and easy to remember.

### Mailing lists

As mentioned above in the rejection of SE-0159, Doug Gregor has [opened a new discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170403/034903.html) about implementing type-based 'private' access within a file &mdash; which will hopefully settle Swift's access control story for good.

> In rejecting [SE-0159](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0159-fix-private-access-levels.md), the core team described a potential direction we would like to investigate for “private” access control that admits a limited form of type-based access control within files. The core team is seeking some discussion here and a motivated volunteer to put together a proposal along these lines for review in the Swift 4 time-frame (i.e., very soon). To be clear, the core team isn't sure this is the right direction to go... but it appears promising and we would *love* to be able to settle the access-control issue.
>
> The design, specifically, is that a “private” member declared within a type “X” or an extension thereof would be accessible from:
>
> * An extension of “X” in the same file
> * The definition of “X”, if it occurs in the same file
> * A nested type (or extension thereof) of one of the above that occurs in the same file
>
> This design has a number of apparent benefits:
> * `private` becomes the right default for "less than whole module" visibility, and aligns well with Swift coding style that divides a type’s definition into a number of extensions.
> * `fileprivate` remains for existing use cases, but now it’s use it more rare, which has several advantages:
>   * It fits well with the "progressive disclosure" philosophy behind Swift: you can use `public`/`internal`/`private` for a while before encountering and having to learn about `fileprivate` (note: we thought this was going to be true of [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md), but we were clearly wrong)
>   * When `fileprivate` occurs, it means there’s some interesting coupling between different types in the same file. That makes `fileprivate` a useful alert to the reader rather than, potentially, something that we routinely use and overlook so that we can separate implementations into extensions.
> * `private` is more closely aligned with other programming languages that use type-based access control, which can help programmers just coming to Swift. When they reach for `private`, they’re likely to get something similar to what they expect—with a little Swift twist due to Swift’s heavy use of extensions.
> * Loosening the access restrictions on `private` is unlikely to break existing code.
>
> There are likely some drawbacks:
> * Developers using patterns that depend on the existing lexically-scoped access control of `private` may find this new interpretation of `private` to be insufficiently strict
> * Swift’s access control would go from "entirely lexical" to "partly lexical and partly type-based", which can be viewed as being more complicated
>
> Thoughts? Volunteer?

### Finally

And finally &mdash; the `isn't` [operator](https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/848172027760574465). 😂
