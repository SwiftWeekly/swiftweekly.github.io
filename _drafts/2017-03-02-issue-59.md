### Accepted proposals

[SE-0154](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0154-dictionary-key-and-value-collections.md): *Provide Custom Collections for Dictionary Keys and Values* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000324.html) for Swift 4.

> Feedback was generally positive, and the core team felt that this proposal was a useful step forward for `Dictionary`, providing more flexibility for the standard library ABI and better performance. However, the core team noted that acceptance of this proposal should not preclude improvements to the ergonomics of `Dictionary`, even for the use cases described in the proposal itself (e.g., inserting an empty collection if it isnâ€™t already there, and appending a value to the collection).
