What happened since last week other than [the Internet](https://twitter.com/awscloud/status/836666493668466689) [bursting](https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/) [into flames](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html)? Let's find out! 😄

### News and community

The Mozilla mobile team [wrote about their migration to Swift 3.0](https://mozilla-mobile.github.io/ios/firefox/swift/core/2017/02/22/migrating-to-swift-3.0.html) for [Firefox for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios). It's another in-depth look from the community at the pain, sweat, and tears involved in migrating. If we're lucky, this will be one of the last posts we see like this. The unique thing about Firefox is that the entire app is [open source](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios), so you see the details up close. The good news, however, is that future versions of the Swift compiler (beginning with 3.1) will feature a "compatibility mode" which should help ease these kinds of transitions &mdash; not to mention, source-breaking changes now undergo much more scrutiny.

Craig Hockenberry wrote an article, [Swift Changes Considered Harmful](http://furbo.org/2017/02/17/swift-changes-considered-harmful/). He notes a very practical negative impact of Swift's rapid evolution, that  WWDC sample code **from 2016** no longer compiles and StackOverflow answers are often outdated &mdash; resulting in a detrimental experience for beginners. There's at least one solution here: Apple should update all Swift code samples for Swift 3.0 or provide sample code in Objective-C.

[Keith Smiley](https://twitter.com/SmileyKeith/status/835677088724049921) had one of those "this StackOverflow answer should be a blog post" moments, answering [a question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37847271/is-it-possible-to-dump-the-ast-while-building-an-xcode-project/42463996#42463996) about dumping the Swift AST of an app. And then he wrote [some scripts](https://github.com/keith/xcode-ast-dump) to help! 👏 🙌

Thanks to [Peter Steinberger](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/835043149840068608), I discovered Sandy Martel's [swiftpp](https://github.com/sandym/swiftpp) project. *"swiftpp is a clang tool that automatically generates the glue code to let a swift class inherit from a C++ class. You can override C++ virtual methods from the swift derivative as well."*

Another project of note is [Tulsi](https://github.com/bazelbuild/tulsi) &mdash; an Xcode Project Generator for [bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel), Google's build tool. (Similar to Facebook's [buck](https://github.com/facebook/buck).) If everyone keeps building their own build tools, I'm sure one of them will eventually mostly work most of the time. 😄 Maybe Xcode [should be open source](http://isxcodeopensourceyet.github.io)?

### Commits and pull requests

[Last week](/issue-58/) I lamented Graydon Hoare's [revert](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7676) of the [bridging PCH feature](https://swift.org/blog/bridging-pch/) by default. This week Ted Kremenek [reverted the revert](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7763) to again make bridging PCH the default. [I heard the Core Team likes reverts](https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder609/500x/67178609.jpg).

Roman Levenstein ([@swiftix](https://github.com/swiftix)) merged [improvements](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7751) to the SIL optimizer, resulting in reducing the code size of the stdlib by about 9.4%.

Ben Cohen ([@airspeedswift](https://github.com/airspeedswift)) got the 👩‍❤️‍👩 emoji [working](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/ad080c1db3dd15a129deab2de0f8956b5df58e22) on the `unicode-rethink` branch.

Nate Cook ([@natecook1000](https://github.com/natecook1000)) [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7617) a benchmark for quadratic hash performance to help address [SR-3268](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3268).

Nethra Ravindran ([@nethraravindran](https://github.com/nethraravindran)) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/897) a memory leak in `NSURLComponents` in corelibs-foundation.

The **@swift-ci** bot got a [cute new avatar](https://github.com/swift-ci)!

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0153](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0153-compensate-for-the-inconsistency-of-nscopyings-behaviour.md): *Compensate for the inconsistency of `@NSCopying`'s behaviour* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-March/000327.html) for Swift 4.

> The proposal is accepted using the “compiler magic” approach, where the compiler will introduce the copy within the initialization to maintain the invariant that the stored property is always initialized with or set to a copy of the provided value.
>
> Feedback from the review was mixed. There was general agreement that this was a real problem that does require a solution, but the discussion during the review slightly favored the more conservative approach of adding a warning in the compiler. This was based on two main concerns about introducing the copy within the initializer:
>
> 1) `@NSCopying` would act differently from `didSet`, the latter of which still would not be called within initializers, and
> 2) Concern that property behaviors would not be able to model the semantics described here.
>
> The core team felt that `@NSCopying` needs to guarantee that the copy occurs under all circumstances, and that a change in language semantics here is warranted. Regarding concern (1), the core team felt that `@NSCopying` and `didSet` are different enough that different behavior is reasonable and expected. Regarding concern (2), the core team noted that property behaviors can model the new semantics by providing behaviors with an extra customization point that is invoked from within the initializer (and does not have access to “self”). Moreover, having this customization point in property behaviors will make concern (1) less acute, because property behaviors can and will differ in their initialization vs. setting behavior.

[SE-0154](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0154-dictionary-key-and-value-collections.md): *Provide Custom Collections for Dictionary Keys and Values* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000324.html) for Swift 4.

> Feedback was generally positive, and the core team felt that this proposal was a useful step forward for `Dictionary`, providing more flexibility for the standard library ABI and better performance. However, the core team noted that acceptance of this proposal should not preclude improvements to the ergonomics of `Dictionary`, even for the use cases described in the proposal itself (e.g., inserting an empty collection if it isn’t already there, and appending a value to the collection).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0156](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0156-subclass-existentials.md): *Class and Subtype existentials* by David Hart and Austin Zheng is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000325.html).

> This proposal brings more expressive power to the type system by allowing Swift to represent existentials of classes and subtypes which conform to protocols.
>
> Currently, the only existentials which can be represented in Swift are conformances to a set of protocols, using the & protocol composition syntax: `Protocol1 & Protocol2`.
>
> On the other hand, Objective-C is capable of expressing existentials of classes and subclasses conforming to protocols with the following syntax: `id<Protocol1, Protocol2>`, `Base<Protocol>*`.
>
> We propose to provide similar expressive power to Swift, which will also improve the bridging of those types from Objective-C.

[SE-0157](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0157-recursive-protocol-constraints.md): *Support recursive constraints on associated types* by Douglas Gregor, Erica Sadun, and Austin Zheng is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000326.html).

> This proposal lifts restrictions on associated types in protocols. Their constraints will be allowed to reference any protocol, including protocols that depend on the enclosing one (recursive constraints).

### Mailing lists

Nevin Brackett-Rozinsky [started a thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170220/033112.html), *A Comprehensive Rethink of Access Levels in Swift*.

> There has been a deluge of discussion about access levels lately, all attempting to simplify the situation. Shortly after Swift 3 was released, many people realized that the new access modifier story was far more complex than the old one, and expressed the belief that the changes may have been a mistake.
>
> In the months that followed, more and more people came to share the same view, and stage 2 of Swift 4 has seen a profusion of proposals addressing the issue. These proposals are generally small and focus on changing just one aspect of access control. However, given the situation we are in now, it is important to look at the problem in its entirety and arrive at a cohesive solution.
