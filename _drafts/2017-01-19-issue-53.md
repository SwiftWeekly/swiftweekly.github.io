Welcome to the weekly! As of Tuesday, January 17 `master` branch development has [officially switched](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170109/001070.html) to Swift 4.0. This marked the last periodic merge of `master` into the `swift-3.1-branch` branch. Anything else going into Swift 3.1 will now required approval from our new Swift overload, [Ted Kremenek](https://github.com/tkremenek). ðŸ˜„ I suppose this means we're officially commencing [Swift 4 Phase 1](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000269.html).

### Starter tasks

- [SR-3625](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3625): [Swift Package Manager] Make `Process` class thread safe
- [SR-3455](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3455): [Compiler] Evaluation and validation of build conditions should be separate
- [SR-3343](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3343): [Standard library] Investigate `Array` canaries for `withUnsafe*` operations

### News and community

Hopefully everyone has had time to absorb [last week's news](/issue-52/) that Chris Lattner will be leaving Apple. Nothing has changed, right?! ðŸ˜„ Lattner was [interviewed by MacRumors](http://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/17/chris-lattner-says-tesla-irresistible/) where he elaborated a bit more on his decision. There are no conspiracy theories here. After 16 years of working on developer tools, wouldn't you be ready for something new too? Remember, Lattner also started and left LLVM, a project that continues to thrive.

The [Accednetal Tech Podcast](https://twitter.com/atpfm) also [interviewed Chris Lattner](http://atp.fm/episodes/205) in their latest episode. It's great and definitely worth a listen!

In cased you missed it back in December or just need a refresher, there's an official blog post on the [*Swift 3.1 Release Process*](https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-1-release-process/).

### Commits and pull requests

Karl Weinmeister ([@kweinmeister](https://github.com/kweinmeister)) sent a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/791) that implements and tests `EnergyFormatter` in corelibs-foundation.

Hugh Bellamy ([@hughbe](https://github.com/hughbe)) [ported](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6821) swift-demangle to Windows.

Matthew Carroll ([@matthewcarroll](https://github.com/matthewcarroll)) submitted [a fix](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6823) for starter bug [SR-2475](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2475), which adds a diagnostic that warns when an unlabeled parameter follows a variadic parameter.

Arthur Sabintsev ([@ArtSabintsev](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev)) [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6776) `XCTAssertNoThrow` in the SDK overlays for Swift and also [add support](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/184) for this in corelibs-xctest.

Chris Eidhof opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/584/files) on swift-evolution with an initial draft of his generic subscripts proposal.

Proposal [SE-0080](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0080-failable-numeric-initializers.md): *Failable Numeric Conversion Initializers* has officially [been marked as implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/commit/24aafe9aa0cbcec757ab495c32e8718d14d5f809) for Swift 3.1.

### Proposals

Max Moiseev ([@moiseev](https://github.com/moiseev)) sent [an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170109/030191.html) regarding the status of proposal [SE-0104](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md): *Protocol-oriented integers*, which was accepted for Swift 3 but **not** completed in time.

> Back in June 2016 we discussed the new design of the integer types for the standard library. It even resulted in acceptance of [SE-0104](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md) for Swift 3. Unfortunately we were not able to implement it in time for the release.
>
> But it was not forgotten, although, as time went by, a few changes needed to be made in order to reflect the current state of the language.
Without further introduction, please welcome the refined proposal to make integers in Swift more suitable for generic programming.

There is a fancy new [status page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/)! Kyle Murray ([@krilnon](https://github.com/krilnon/)) built the new status page and wrote a [blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-evolution-status-page/) announcing the [changes](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/589). It seems like he will also review proposal pull requests, as stated in the newly added [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

> To help make sense of it all, the status page has several ways to navigate through the list of proposals. You can search for specific authors, review managers, and topics by keyword. You can narrow the list to show only the proposals that were implemented in a particular version of Swift.

The new site looks great! You can search based on proposal metadata but not proposal contents. I suppose this mostly replaces my [swift-proposal-analyzer](https://github.com/jessesquires/swift-proposal-analyzer) project. ðŸ˜… [Sherlocked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software))!

### Mailing lists

As mentioned above, Nicole Jacque sent [an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170109/001070.html) announcing the final merge from `master`:

> As outlined in Ted's Swift 3.1 Release Process blog post, for the past month, weâ€™ve been periodically merging `master` to the `swift-3.1-branch` branch.  We will be doing one final merge of master to the `swift-3.1-branch` on January 17 at noon (Pacific). Note that we've pushed this back a day due to the MLK Jr. Day holiday. Any changes landed after that time will require approval via a pull request against the `swift-3.1-branch` branch in order to include them in the Swift 3.1 release. After this final merge, development on master will be targeted for Swift 4.
>
> Snapshots of the `swift-3.1-branch` will be made available on the [downloads page](https://swift.org/download/). Snapshots will be made available daily, if all package generation CI tests are passing.

Adam Shin started [a discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170109/030183.html) on equatability for enums with associated values, proposing that Swift add support for `enum` values with `Equatable` associated types be automatically `Equatable` too.

> When using enums with associated values, it's often necessary to check for equality between two enum objects in some way. That can lead to boilerplate [...] which results in code duplication and opens the door to potential logic errors.
>
> Instead, what if enums with associated values were automatically `Equatable` when all their associated values were `Equatable`? That would remove the need for such boilerplate code.
