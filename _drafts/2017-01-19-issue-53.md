Welcome to the weekly! As of Tuesday, January 17 `master` branch development has [officially switched](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170109/001070.html) to Swift 4.0. This marked the last periodic merge of `master` into the `swift-3.1-branch` branch. Anything else going into Swift 3.1 will now required approval from our new Swift overload, [Ted Kremenek](https://github.com/tkremenek). ðŸ˜„ I suppose this means we're officially commencing [Swift 4 Phase 1](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-July/000269.html).

### News and community

Hopefully everyone has had time to absorb [last week's news](/issue-52/) that Chris Lattner will be leaving Apple. Nothing has changed, right?! ðŸ˜„ Lattner was [interviewed by MacRumors](http://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/17/chris-lattner-says-tesla-irresistible/) where he elaborated a bit more on his decision. There are no conspiracy theories here. After 16 years of working of working on developer tools, wouldn't you be ready for something new too?

In cased you missed it back in December or just need a refresher, there's an official blog post on the [*Swift 3.1 Release Process*](https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-1-release-process/).

### Commits and pull requests

> TODO

### Proposals

There are no updates on proposals themselves, but there is a fancy new [status page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/)! Kyle Murray ([@krilnon](https://github.com/krilnon/)) built the new status page and wrote a [blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-evolution-status-page/) announcing the changes. It seems like he will also review future proposals, as stated in the newly added [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

> To help make sense of it all, the status page has several ways to navigate through the list of proposals. You can search for specific authors, review managers, and topics by keyword. You can narrow the list to show only the proposals that were implemented in a particular version of Swift.

The new site looks great! It looks like you can search based on proposal metadata but not proposal contents. I suppose this mostly replaces my [swift-proposal-analyzer](https://github.com/jessesquires/swift-proposal-analyzer) project. ðŸ˜… [Sherlocked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software))!

### Mailing lists

As mentioned above, Nicole Jacque sent [an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-corelibs-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170109/001070.html) announcing the final merge from `master`:

> As outlined in Ted's Swift 3.1 Release Process blog post, for the past month, weâ€™ve been periodically merging `master` to the `swift-3.1-branch` branch.  We will be doing one final merge of master to the `swift-3.1-branch` on January 17 at noon (Pacific). Note that we've pushed this back a day due to the MLK Jr. Day holiday. Any changes landed after that time will require approval via a pull request against the `swift-3.1-branch` branch in order to include them in the Swift 3.1 release. After this final merge, development on master will be targeted for Swift 4.
>
> Snapshots of the `swift-3.1-branch` will be made available on the [downloads page](https://swift.org/download/). Snapshots will be made available daily, if all package generation CI tests are passing.

### Finally

> TODO: something funny/fun. tweet, link, etc.
