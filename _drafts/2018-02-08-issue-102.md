### News and community

[Greg Heo](https://twitter.com/gregheo) wrote an amazing post about [Conditional conformance](https://swiftunboxed.com/lang/conditional-conformance/). In it, he thinks through conditional conformance in Swift, and works through the basics of its implementation.

[Xi Ge](https://github.com/nkcsgexi)'s talk about [Creating Refactoring Transformations for Swift](https://www.skilled.io/u/swiftsummit/creating-refactoring-transformations-for-swift) from the [Swift Summit 2017](https://www.swiftsummit.com/) is posted. He also talks about future of refactoring engine with [libSyntax](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/lib/Syntax/README.md).

[Brandon Williams](http://www.fewbutripe.com/about/) and [Stephen Celis](http://www.stephencelis.com/) launched a new Swift video series called [Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co/). Checkout their first episode, [Functions](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep1-functions).
>Point-Free is a video series about functional programming and the Swift programming language. Each episode covers a topic that may seem complex and academic at first, but turns out to be quite simple. At the end of each episode we’ll ask “what’s the point?!”, so that we can bring the concepts back down to earth and show how these ideas can improve the quality of your code today.

[Peter Steinberger](https://twitter.com/steipete) wrote about [Binary Frameworks in Swift](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/binary-frameworks-swift/)
>This article explores what ABI means and how it can be important for third-party frameworks.
> <br/>TL;WR: ABI stability won’t change much for you, and it’s not enough to ship binary Swift frameworks.



### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://github.com/DougGregor) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/14174) an [issue](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6841) in type checker where class constraints `(spelled T: AnyObject)` on generic types were not getting checked on generic arguments.

[Greg Titus](https://github.com/gregomni) [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/14227) a pull request that removes compiler terminology l-value. As mentioned by Slava Pestov in this [tweet](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/957720067822706688)
> “Removing terminology” is almost always good. Compilers often use terminology that is internal to the implementation, not part of the language model, and can change.

[Connor Wakamo](https://github.com/cwakamo) [proposed](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/784) to 
Replace PlaygroundQuickLook/CustomPlaygroundQuickLookable with new API
> This proposal has been discussed on the mailing list/forum, and is now ready for official review. As noted in the proposal, parts of it are targeted at Swift 4.1 (deprecation of the old API and introduction of the new API) and others are targeted at Swift 5 (removal of the old API and introduction of a playground-specific shim library).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0197](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0197-add-in-place-remove-where/8872): Adding in-place `remove(where:)` to the Standard Library is in review.
> It is common to want to remove all occurrences of a certain element from a collection. This proposal is to add a remove algorithm to the standard library, which will remove all entries in a collection in-place matching a given predicate.
