I am back! I had the most wonderful time at WWDC, learning a lot of and meeting awesome people.
I want to specifically thank all those that have shown their gratitude for the weekly brief, it's much appreciated!

Without further ado, here's this week's news on the Swift.org open source projects.

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-7984](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7984) [Compiler] Constraint to concrete type using `:` should offer a fixit
- [SR-8012](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8012) [Standard Library] Remove `Indexable` aliases
- [SR-8049](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8049) [Swift for TensorFlow] Open source S4TF unit testing with a remote TF session

### Swift Unwrapped

In [episode 63](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/147483), Jesse and JP discuss Swift algorithms and data structures with [Kelvin Lau](https://twitter.com/KelvinlauKl) and [Vincent Ngo](https://twitter.com/VincentNgo2).

In [episode 64](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/160151), Jesse and JP discuss `Never`, the [return type of functions that do not return normally](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/never).

### News and community

[Ole Begemann](https://twitter.com/olebegemann) wrote [a blog post](https://oleb.net/blog/2018/06/dynamic-member-lookup/) with thoughts on `@dynamicMemberLookup`, which was introduced in [SE-0195](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0195-dynamic-member-lookup.md).

[John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) discussed the Swift Package Manager with [David Hart](https://twitter.com/dhartbit) in his [podcast](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/26).

### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://github.com/slavapestov) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/17227) to fix a corner case for source compatibility. As it appears, using an enum case called `init` could cause some trouble.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0211](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0211-unicode-scalar-properties.md): *Add Unicode Properties to `Unicode.Scalar`* has been [accepted with revisions](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0211-add-unicode-properties-to-unicode-scalar/13857/1).

> The core team has accepted this proposal, with one revision:
>
> - the `numericValue` property should be a `Double?` rather than a `Double`, with `nil` for non-numeric values rather than `NaN`.

[SE-0214](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0214-DictionaryLiteral.md): *Renaming the `DictionaryLiteral` type to `KeyValuePairs`* has been [accepted with revisions](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-revision-se-0214-renaming-the-dictionaryliteral-type-to-keyvaluepairs/13661).

> In the review thread discussion, many names were considered, and the core team agreed that `KeyValuePairs` (initially `KeyValueList` was proposed) is a best name suggested on the thread for this type.

### Swift Forums

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r/) shared some [features and enhancements](https://forums.swift.org/t/recent-swiftpm-features-and-enhancements/13807) that have been brought to SwiftPM recently.

> - Improved scheme generation logic
> - Local dependencies
> - Automatic Xcode project generation
> - System library targets
> - Embeddable Xcode projects

[Dave DeLong](https://twitter.com/davedelong) and [Erica Sadun](https://twitter.com/ericasadun) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/introducing-namespacing-for-common-swift-error-scenarios/10773) to introduce namespacing for common Swift error scenarios.

> This proposal introduces namespacing for fatal errors. It provides an umbrella for common exit scenarios, modernizing a holdover from C-like languages.
>
> Swiftâ€™s `fatalError` is arguably insufficient for a multitude of real world uses including discoverability, extensibility, and significance. Swift lacks a modern extensible solution that differentiates fatal error scenarios. 

Awesome stuff!

### Finally
