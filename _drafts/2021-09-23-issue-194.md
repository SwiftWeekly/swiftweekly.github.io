### Starter tasks

### Commits and pull requests

[salinas-miguel](https://github.com/salinas-miguel)'s PR that removes the Swift project's dependency on Foundation on macOS was [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/39216).

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) created [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/39342) to back-deploy concurrency.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0323](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0323-async-main-semantics.md): *Asynchronous Main Semantics* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0323-asynchronous-main-semantics/52022).

> Program setup generally occurs in the main function where developers expect to perform operations before other parts of the program are run. Objective-C, C++, and C have initializers that are run before the main entrypoint runs and can interact with Swift's concurrency systems in ways that are hard to reason about. In the Swift concurrency model, the developer-written asynchronous main function is wrapped in a task and enqueued on the main queue when the main entrypoint is run. If an initializer inserts a task on the main queue, that task may be executed before the main function, so setup is performed after initializer tasks are run.

[SE-0324](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0324-c-lang-pointer-arg-conversion.md): *Relax diagnostics for pointer arguments to C functions* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0324-relax-diagnostics-for-pointer-arguments-to-c-functions/52019).

> C has special rules for pointer aliasing, for example allowing `char *` to alias other pointer types, and allowing pointers to signed and unsigned types to alias. The usability of some C APIs relies on the ability to easily cast pointers within the boundaries of those rules. Swift generally disallows typed pointer conversion. See [SE-0107 UnsafeRawPointer API](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0107-unsaferawpointer.md). Teaching the Swift compiler to allow pointer conversion within the rules of C when invoking functions imported from C headers will dramatically improve interoperability with no negative impact on type safety.

### Swift Forums

[Ashley Garland](https://forums.swift.org/u/bitjammer) [introduced](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-snippets/51947) some experimental work for a new Swift Package Manager feature for _snippets_.

> We all know that learning by example is great, especially for code. I wanted to create the smallest, simplest method of providing example code for Swift packages, and I've just landed some [work in progress in the Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/commit/a0ffd92a2c80f2c4677d696e248f4cfbec9d6540).

[Filip Sakel](https://forums.swift.org/u/filip-sakel) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-refining-property-wrapper-related-initialization/52049) to refine property wrapper related initialization.

> [SE 0258](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0258-property-wrappers.md) introduced property wrappers and [SE 0293](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0293-extend-property-wrappers-to-function-and-closure-parameters.md#detailed-design) expanded them with function-like declarations. Today, property wrapper initialization exhibits inconsistencies due to its growing versatility. Specifically, memberwise initializers use complex, poorly documented rules and projection initialization remains limited. This proposal will simplify synthesized memberwise initialization for types with wrapped properties and extend projection value initialization to include global, type, and local wrapped properties.
