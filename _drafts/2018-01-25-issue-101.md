### Swift Unwrapped

While we've been away, Jesse and JP have discussed [Improving Compilation Performance](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/100849), [Conditional Conformance](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/105029) (read more in the blog post [here](https://swift.org/blog/conditional-conformance/)), and the [State of String](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/105667).

### News and community

Ben Cohen [shared](https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift/status/950446966126751744) that with Swift 4.1, which includes [conditional conformance](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0143-conditional-conformances.md) and [recursive protocol constraints](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0157-recursive-protocol-constraints.md), we are getting closer and closer to ABI stability, Swift 5's major goal.

### Swift Forums

Michael Ilseman gave [an update](https://forums.swift.org/t/state-of-string-abi-performance-ergonomics-and-you/7397) on the State of String in regards to the ABI, performance, ergonomics and more.

> I’ve been working on implementing, optimizing, and improving String in preparation for ABI stability, and I thought I’d share the current status of String in Swift 5 and some potential directions to go. This is the product of conversations with open source contributors and my colleagues on the Swift standard library team at Apple.

### Finally

And finally... the [Access Control debate](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/955931838320492544) continues.
