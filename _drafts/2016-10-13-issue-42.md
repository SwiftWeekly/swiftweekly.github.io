### Starter tasks

- [SR-2902](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2902): [Compiler] Add a timer and debug flag for expression type checking. (Thanks [Ben Asher](https://twitter.com/benasher44/status/785192508158377984)!)
- [SR-2910](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2910): [Compiler] Log property name for synthesized properties in `-debug-time-function-bodies` output (Thanks [Ben Asher](https://twitter.com/benasher44/status/785578563084791808)!)

### Community

Ole Begemann wrote a great post on [*Optional Non-Escaping Closures*](https://oleb.net/blog/2016/10/optional-non-escaping-closures/). In Swift 3, non-escaping closure are the default. If you are still confused about how/when to use `@escaping`, this is a great read. Ole also explores some finer details and gotchas.

### Commits and pull requests

Doug Gregor [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/541) the swift-evolution repository for Swift 4 stage 1. 🎉 Swift 4.0's expected release date is *late 2017*, so mark your calendars!

As Brian Gesiak mentioned in [issue #39](/issue-39/), source-breaking really are hard to determine(https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4878#issuecomment-252695257). It turns out that Slava's changes to variadic parameters [were actually breaking](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2907).

### Proposals

No new proposals this week, but the [status page](http://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) has been updated to include Swift 3.0.1, Swift 3.1, and Swift 4.

### Mailing lists

Chris Lattner [shed some light](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160926/027337.html) on the future dynamic aspects of Swift. *"The core team is committed to adding powerful dynamic features to Swift."*

> The primary reason that Swift currently lacks these features is simple prioritization.  It has unfortunately not been the highest priority to build, because we already have working systems for all of those in Cocoa, and things like source stability and binary stability (among other things) are more important to the Swift community in the moment.  As Swift evolves, they will bubble up in the priority list.
>
> I know that having a read/write data reflection API is the top of the list for many people, and having the ability to reflect on methods is also important for some patterns.  I look forward to the community having the bandwidth to properly design and debate these things, because I’m confident that there are good answers for these.
>
> That said, to be clear, this is definitely out of scope for Swift 4 Stage 1, which is our current mode.  We need to stay focused in the short term on the most pressing issues, which revolve around Source and ABI stability.

### Finally

[We are willing to make the internal implementation of Swift complex if that means that we get a beautiful model for programmers](https://twitter.com/ericasadun/status/784528752822849536). 👏
