### Accepted proposals

[SE-0319](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0319-never-identifiable.md) *Never as Identifiable* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0319-never-as-identifiable/50473).

### Returned proposals

[SE-0318](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0318-package-creation/) has been [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0318-package-creation/50474).

> The feedback from the review highlighted further refinement that can be done to the ergonomics of the proposed solution including the templating system. For example, the proposal can make it clearer why a new command is desired compared to enhancing the existing package init command, and explore a templating system that supports for multi-template-single-repo and programatic interfaces.
> 
> The proposal authors are encouraged to consider these alternative design ideas, and pitch a modified version of the proposal to the community.

### Swift Forums

[Gutley](https://forums.swift.org/u/gutley) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/catching-unwanted-uses-of-on-optionset/50566) to implement a solution to catch unwanted uses of `~=` on OptionSet.

[Johannes Auer](https://forums.swift.org/t/pre-pitch-asyncvalue/50590) pitched a proposal to add `AsyncValue`.

> While migrating a project to the new async features of Swift I constantly needed a mechanism for a synchronization point based of the availability of some value. As far as I can tell, currently there is nothing in the stdlib to cover this.
>
> Basically this is something like an 'AsyncSequence' with only 1 value.
