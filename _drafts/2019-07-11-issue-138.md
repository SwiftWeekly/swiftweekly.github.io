### Proposals in review


[SE-0258](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0258-property-wrappers.md): Property Wrappers (third review).

> This is the third review of SE-0258. After the first review, the Core Team requested further development of the proposal to address some [concerns](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0258-property-delegates/24080) raised during the review. That development led to a major revision and a [second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0258-property-wrappers-second-review/25843). After considering the early feedback during the second review, the proposal authors asked to make a second round of revisions, and the Core Team has decided that those changes are substantial enough to require a third review.
