> TODO: Latest episode(s) of Swift Unwrapped & the Swift Community Podcast

In the latest episode of Swift by Sundell episode [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) and [Chriss Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) talks about Swiftâ€™s past, present and future.

Property Wrappers lately is becoming an important topic in Swift community that's why [JP](https://twitter.com/simjp) and [Jessie](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires) are discussing about that in [latest Swift Unwrapped podcast episode](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/302918).

### News and community

> TODO

[Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) and [Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) shared a [blog post](https://medium.com/tensorflow/fast-ais-deep-learning-from-the-foundations-with-swift-for-tensorflow-3ee7dfb68387) about releasing Swift for TensorFlow v0.4

[Vincent Pradeilles](https://twitter.com/v_pradeilles) wrote an article explaining [how can Property Wrappers and Function Builders be leveraged](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/how-can-property-wrappers-and-function-builders-be-leveraged-d43160de338f) in Swift.


### Commits and pull requests

> TODO

[Jordan Rose](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25624) showing 'some' type origins in diagnostics, like 'aka' for sugared types.

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://twitter.com/pyaskevich) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25892) that resolves [SR-10987](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-10987): Compiler crashes on invalid reference to 'subscript' member.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) pointed out that looks like the Swift-TensorFlow folks are [working on C++ interoperability](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/25870).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0258](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0258-property-wrappers.md): Property Wrappers (third review).

> This is the third review of SE-0258. After the first review, the Core Team requested further development of the proposal to address some [concerns](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0258-property-delegates/24080) raised during the review. That development led to a major revision and a [second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0258-property-wrappers-second-review/25843). After considering the early feedback during the second review, the proposal authors asked to make a second round of revisions, and the Core Team has decided that those changes are substantial enough to require a third review.

[SE-0261](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0261-identifiable.md): Identifiable Protocol

> This proposal introduces an `Identifiable` protocol, a general concept that is broadly useful - for diff algorithms, user interface libraries, and other generic code - to correlate snapshots of the state of an entity in order to identify changes. It is a fundamental notion that deserves representation in the standard library.

> Swift-evolution thread: [Move SwiftUI's `Identifiable` and related types into the standard library](https://forums.swift.org/t/move-swiftuis-identifiable-protocol-and-related-types-into-the-standard-library/25713)


### Swift Forums

[Johannes Weiss]() shared [meeting notes](https://forums.swift.org/t/june-27th-2019/26580) from June 27th Swift Server Working Group meeting.

> Naming:
> * summary: there are no good solutions so we need a compromise
> * we might be overthinking the problem but existing clashes have shown how hard it is to unbreak a clash
> * after a lot of discussion we came to the conclusion that 'despite nobody liking cutesy names very much there are the most lightweight workable solution'. However we won't prescribe cute names
> * try to stay unique, cutesy/clearly unique name preferred for the time being


[Argyrios Kyrtzidis](https://twitter.com/akyrtzi) explained about plans to [integrate libSyntax into compiler pipeline](https://forums.swift.org/t/integrating-libsyntax-into-the-compiler-pipeline/26605).

> We have been developing libSyntax (and SwiftSyntax as the Swift counterpart) whose purpose is to represent the syntax of Swift source code with full fidelity (including whitespace), enable structured editing, provide immutable, thread-safe data structures, and support incremental re-parsing.


[Anthony Platanios](https://twitter.com/eaplatanios) started a discussion about [removing the 'Comparable' constraint for 'Numeric.Magniteude'](https://forums.swift.org/t/removing-the-comparable-constraint-for-numeric-magnitude/26498).

> As part of Swift for TensorFlow we have been working towards designing a set of protocols that more closely resemble mathematical concepts and can, for example, be used for conveniently implementing numerical optimizers. In trying to integrate our changes with the standard library we bumped into an issue related to Numeric. We have already designed a few protocols (e.g., VectorProtocol and PointwiseMultiplicative) for which we support automatic conformance derivation for aggregate types (e.g., structs containing tensors). We want to also support Numeric derivations for such aggregate structures and the current issue is that the Comparable constraint on Magnitude is causing some issues as it's not straightforward what the semantics should be.


[Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) pointed out post by [Argyrios Kyrtzidis](https://twitter.com/akyrtzi) about [bringing formatting technology to SourceKit-LSP](https://forums.swift.org/t/formatting-technology-for-sourcekit-lsp-and-other-tools/26560).

> Formatting is integral to the experience of editing source code which why it is included in the LSP specification. This functionality, however, is currently missing from SourceKit-LSP. We want to provide users a great out-of-the-box experience of using SourceKit-LSP, across all editors and platforms, and first-class support for formatting is a critical piece of the experience.

> For SourceKit-LSP we'd like to have formatting functionality that is:

> 1. Fast and capable of real-time, "as you type", performance
> 2. Be robust and work even in the presence of invalid code
> 3. Work in contexts that may only provide a string of Swift source code for context such as snippets in code-review

### Finally

> TODO: something funny/fun. tweet, link, etc.
