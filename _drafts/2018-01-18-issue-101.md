Welcome to issue #101! 

<!--excerpt-->

{% include sponsor.html %}

### Starter tasks

1. [SR-6706](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6706): Swift should complain about weak references to classes that don't support them
2. [SR-6691](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6691): Sequence.split should have a Lazy equivalent
3. [SR-6736](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6736): Enforce 16-bit limit for # of function parameters, # of tuple type element

### Commits and pull requests

- Ben Cohen continued his work on [Zip collection](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13941/). Zip refers to combining elements as tuples.<br/>
For E.g. in Haskell<br/>
Input:<br/>
`zip [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]`<br/>
Output:<br/>
`[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]`

- Thomas Roughton [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13299) Remove TwoWordPair and use the Swift calling convention instead.
>Historically, TwoWordPair seems to be a >4 year old hack that worked around the lack of a dedicated calling convention to interoperate with Swift
>Now that SwiftCC exists (and works on Windows, once [apple/swift-clang#142](https://github.com/apple/swift-clang/pull/142) is merged) we don't need that hack anymore and can instead mark all functions that used TwoWordPair::Return as using the Swift calling convention.

- Timur Islamgulov added a [Fix-it](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13899) for using `0` for a RawOptionSetType.

- hamishknight created a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13910) which fixes a runtime exception casting an Any? nil to a generic optional.

- Pavel Yaskevich created a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/13986) that could significantly speedup the typechecking for complex expressions.
>If overload set contains both protocol requirement and its witnesses
let's only leave requirement itself active until we know that it matches,
in such case we'd re-enable witness methods and attempt them. This
helps to significantly reduce the number of overload choices we consider
upfront e.g. for '==' operator we can hide 53 choices behind Equatable
protocol from total number of 68 choices.

- Michael Ilseman continued his work on [StringGuts](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12442). The pull request is still work in progress and has diverged from master by more than commits !!!

### Swift Unwrapped

[Episode 41: Improving Compilation Performance.](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/100849) JP and Jesse discuss swift compilation performance based on Graydon Hoareâ€™s [swift-dev email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20171113/006001.html).

### News and community

Ben Cohen wrote about [improvements to conditional conformances](https://swift.org/blog/conditional-conformance/) coming in Swift. This is a very powerful feature.
>The most noticeable benefit of conditional conformance is the ability for types that store other types, like Array or Optional, to conform to the Equatable protocol. This is the protocol that guarantees you can use == between two instances of a type.

### Proposal news

Chris Lattner revised his [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/781 for improving interoperability with dynamic languages. The prior proposals for the same are discussed in the [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/100543) episode.
>The driving motivation for this feature is to improve interoperability with inherently dynamic languages like Python, Javascript, Ruby and others.  That said, this feature is designed such that it can be applied to other inherently dynamic domains in a modular way.

Chris Eidhof pitched a [Bool toggle proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/782) for adding a `mutating func toggle` to `Bool`. This is a straightforward proposal also discussed on his website [objc.io](https://www.objc.io/blog/2018/01/16/toggle-extension-on-bool/).

### Accepted proposals

> TODO

### Returned proposals

[SE-0192 Non-Exhaustive Enums](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0192-non-exhaustive-enums.md) was [returned](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20180108/042814.html).
> The proposal author, Jordan Rose, is working on a revised proposal that includes:
>
> Alterations to the naming of the attributes.
>
> New affordances for how switch statements work with non-exhaustive enums.
>
> There will be a second round of review, but there is active discussion considering the latter point right now on swift-evolution on the thread ["Handling unknown cases in enums"](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20180108/042604.html)

### Rejected proposals

> TODO

### Proposals in review

[SE-0194](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0194-derived-collection-of-enum-cases.md) Derived Collection of Enum Cases is in review; it proposes a solution which will let us iterate through all cases of an Enum.
>We propose the introduction of a protocol, ValueEnumerable, to indicate that a type has a finite, enumerable set of values. Moreover, we propose an opt-in derived implementation of ValueEnumerable for the common case of a simple enum.


### Mailing lists

Michael Ilseman wrote about the [State of String: ABI, Performance, Ergonomics, and You!](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20180108/006407.html) He has been working on implementing, optimizing and improving String in preparation for ABI stability, and is sharing the current status of String in Swift 5 and some potential directions to go.

### Finally
