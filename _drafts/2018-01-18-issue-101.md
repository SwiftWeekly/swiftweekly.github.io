<!--excerpt-->

{% include sponsor.html %}

### Starter tasks

### Swift Unwrapped

[Episode 41: Improving Compilation Performance](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/100849)

### News and community

Ben Cohen wrote about [improvements to conditional conformances](https://swift.org/blog/conditional-conformance/) coming in Swift. This is a very powerful feature, hint: Ever faced with the problem where `XCTAssertEqual` never works with Optionals?

### Proposal pitches

Chris Lattner drafted [yet another proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/781) for improving interoperability with dynamic languages. The prior proposals for the same are discussed in the [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/100543) episode.

Chris Eidhof pitched a [Bool toggle proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/782) for adding a `mutating func toggle` to `Bool`. This is a straightforward proposal also discussed on his website [objc.io](https://www.objc.io/blog/2018/01/16/toggle-extension-on-bool/).


### Accepted proposals

### Returned proposals

[SE-0192 Non-Exhaustive Enums](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0192-non-exhaustive-enums.md) was [returned](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20180108/042814.html).

> Alterations to the naming of the attributes.
>
> New affordances for how switch statements work with non-exhaustive enums.

> There will be a second round of review, but there is active discussion considering the latter point right now on swift-evolution on the thread ["Handling unknown cases in enums"](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20180108/042604.html)

### Rejected proposals

> TODO

### Proposals in review

[SE-0194](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0194-derived-collection-of-enum-cases.md) Derived Collection of Enum Cases is in review; it proposes a solution which will let us iterate through all cases of an Enum.

### Mailing lists

Michael Ilseman wrote about the [State of String: ABI, Performance, Ergonomics, and You!](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20180108/006407.html) He has been working on implementing, optimizing and improving String in preparation for ABI stability, and is sharing the current status of String in Swift 5 and some potential directions to go.
