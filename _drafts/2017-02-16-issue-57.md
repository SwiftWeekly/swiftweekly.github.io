### Starter tasks

- [SR-3936](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3936): Provide a Fix It for errors such as "Computed property must have an explicit type"
- [SR-3882](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3882): `@objc` protocol conformance info isn't recorded when a type conforms to a Swift sub-protocol
- [SR-3867](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3867): Improve diagnostics for labeled block without `do`

### News and community

The engineering team at Airbnb shared their story on [migrating to Swift 3](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/getting-to-swift-3-at-airbnb-79a257d2b656#.453vg69qn). The post covers their approach, the impact of Swift 3 on binary size and build time (both regressed, unfortunately), and some issues to watch out for.

Ole Begemann wrote an article on [implementing a sorted array](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/02/sorted-array/) in Swift.

### Commits and pull requests

David Farler ([@bitjammer](https://github.com/bitjammer)) [started](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7393) the syntax structure editing library. (See below for more details.)

John Szumski ([@jszumski](https://github.com/jszumski)) opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/883) with an initial implementation of `MassFormatter` in corelibs-foundation.

Ankit Aggarwal ([@aciidb0mb3r](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r)) [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/954) tools version support in SPM. ([SE-0152](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0152-package-manager-tools-version.md))

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0151](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0151-package-manager-swift-language-compatibility-version.md): *Package Manager Swift Language Compatibility Version* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000318.html) for Swift 4.

> There wasn't much discussion on the mailing list, but we did receive some off-list feedback that was supportive. The proposal is accepted for Swift 4.

[SE-0152](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0152-package-manager-tools-version.md): *Package Manager Tools Version* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000319.html) for Swift 4.

> There wasn't much discussion on the mailing list, but we did receive some off-list feedback that was supportive. The proposal is accepted for Swift 4.

Both propoals have already been [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/605) as well. 😄🎉

### Mailing lists

David Farler [sent an email](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170206/004066.html) announcing work on the *Swift Syntax and Structured Editing* library:

> A truly modern compiler has to have excellent IDE and tools integration, as we have done through the SourceKit layer, providing code completion, documentation comments, syntax highlighting, and more. There's no reason to stop there, so I'd like to announce work on the Swift Syntax and Structured Editing library, which will be growing in lib/Syntax in the coming weeks. The overall goal of the library is to provide a representation and a body of APIs for structured editing on Swift syntax.
>
> The immediate goals of the library are to provide infrastructure for the Swift Migrator and for a first-class formatting tool, which we'll be bringing to the open source tree and developing publicly.

Chris Bieneman [announced changes](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170206/004048.html) to LLDB branch management:

> Over the last couple weeks we've been working on some changes to the branch management strategy for the Swift-LLDB repository. The goal is to have LLDB more closely align with the other projects forked from [LLVM.org](http://llvm.org/). We believe that making this change will simplify the contribution process for LLDB's Swift support.
>
> To this end, we are making the following changes:
>
> LLDB has gained an `upstream-with-trunk` branch which will be auto-merged from LLVM.org’s `LLDB/trunk`. This branch will contain the best of both worlds. The latest and greatest from LLVM.org, and Swift support. This branch will pair to LLVM & Clang's `upstream-with-swift` branches and Swift’s `master-next`.
>
> LLDB has also gained a stable branch which will behave the same way as the LLVM & Clang stable branches, and should be used for most Swift compiler development. Additionally we have made the `swift-lldb/stable` branch the default branch on the GitHub repository, which matches the behavior of LLVM & Clang.
