### Proposals in review

[SE-0325](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0325-swiftpm-additional-plugin-apis.md): *Additional Package Plugin APIs* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0325-additional-package-plugin-apis/52788).

> SE-0303 introduced the ability to define _build tool plugins_ in SwiftPM, allowing custom tools to be invoked while building a package. In support of this, SE-0303 introduced a minimal initial API through which plugins can access information about the target for which they are invoked.
>
> This proposal extends the plugin API to provide more context, including a richer representation of the package graph. This is in preparation for supporting new kinds of plugins in the future.

### Swift Forums

[Nuri Amari](https://forums.swift.org/u/nuriamari) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-improved-clangimporter-diagnostics/52687) to improve `ClangImporter` diagnostics.

> We would like to propose improvements to the ClangImporter to provide more detailed diagnostics when an entity cannot be imported from C or Objective-C. As it stands, when the ClangImporter fails to import an entity (function, type, macro, etc.) either entirely or partially, failure is largely silent. The current Swift compilation errors present largely as if the entity was never defined at all.

[Frederick Kellison-Linn](https://forums.swift.org/u/jumhyn) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-generalize-keypath-to-function-conversions/52681) to generalize keypath-to-function conversions.

> This proposal introduces the ability to use the key path expression `\Root.value` wherever functions of `(Root) -> Value` are allowed.

[Patrick Pijnappel](https://forums.swift.org/u/patrick_pijnappel) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-exhaustive-pattern-matching-for-non-open-classes/52718) to implement exhaustive pattern matching for non-open classes.

> Since we now make the distinction between open and non-open classes, it seems we should be able to make non-open class hierarchies exhaustively matchable. This would be a nice win for compile-time checks in the face of adding a new subclass, without any added syntax.

Guillaume Lessard [pitched](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-pointer-usability-improvements/52736) to improve pointer usability.

> This proposal introduces some quality-of-life improvements for `UnsafePointer` and its `Mutable` and `Raw` variants.
>
> 1.  Add an API to obtain an `UnsafeRawPointer` instance that is advanced to a given alignment from its starting point.
> 2.  Add an API to obtain a pointer to a stored property of an aggregate `T`, given an `UnsafePointer<T>`.
> 3.  Rename the unchecked subscript of `Unsafe[Mutable]Pointer` to include the argument label `unchecked`.
> 4.  Add the ability to compare pointers of any two types.

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://twitter.com/pyaskevich) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-light-weight-same-type-constraint-syntax/52889) to improve same-type constraint syntax.

> As a step toward the goal of improving the UI of generics outlined in [Improving the UI of generics](https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-ui-of-generics/22814#heading--directly-expressing-constraints), we’d like to propose a couple of improvements that bridge the syntactic gap between protocols and generic types, and hide some of the complexity (both visual and cognitive) of writing same-type constraints on associated types and type parameters of generic types.

[Holly Borla](https://twitter.com/hollyborla) started [a discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/discussion-easing-the-learning-curve-for-introducing-generic-parameters/52891) about easing the learning curve for introducing generic parameters.

> Swift’s generics system is highly expressive, but understanding the full generality of protocols with associated types, generic signatures with where clauses, and other generics features is a significant barrier to introducing generics into a Swift project. A major goal of a more approachable generics system is easing the learning curve of abstracting a concrete API into a generic one by improving the ergonomics of writing generic code in Swift. This discussion is to solicit feedback on possible directions toward achieving this goal, and gather other ideas surfaced by the community. **Questions, comments, and ideas are all welcome!**

> Many of the ideas in this post were laid out by [@Joe_Groff](https://forums.swift.org/u/joe_groff)  in [Improving the UI of generics](https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-ui-of-generics/22814).

[Nate Cook](https://twitter.com/nnnnnnnn) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-character-classes-for-string-processing/52920) to implement character classes for String processing.

> [Declarative String Processing Overview](https://forums.swift.org/t/declarative-string-processing-overview/52459) presents regex-powered matching broadly, without details concerning syntax and semantics, leaving clarification to subsequent pitches. [Regular Expression Literals](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-regular-expression-literals/52820) presents more details on regex _syntax_ such as delimiters and PCRE-syntax innards, but explicitly excludes discussion of regex _semantics_. This pitch and discussion aims to address a targeted subset of regex semantics: definitions of character classes. We propose a comprehensive treatment of regex character class semantics in the context of existing and newly proposed API directly on `Character` and `Unicode.Scalar`.
>
> Character classes in regular expressions include metacharacters like `\d` to match a digit, `\s` to match whitespace, and `.` to match any character. Individual literal characters can also be thought of as character classes, as they at least match themselves, and, in case-insensitive matching, their case-toggled counterpart. For the purpose of this work, then, we consider a _character class_ to be any part of a regular expression literal that can match an actual component of a string.
