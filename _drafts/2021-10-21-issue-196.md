### Proposals in review

[SE-0325](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0325-swiftpm-additional-plugin-apis.md): *Additional Package Plugin APIs* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0325-additional-package-plugin-apis/52788).

> SE-0303 introduced the ability to define _build tool plugins_ in SwiftPM, allowing custom tools to be invoked while building a package. In support of this, SE-0303 introduced a minimal initial API through which plugins can access information about the target for which they are invoked.
>
> This proposal extends the plugin API to provide more context, including a richer representation of the package graph. This is in preparation for supporting new kinds of plugins in the future.

### Swift Forums

[Nuri Amari](https://forums.swift.org/u/nuriamari) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-improved-clangimporter-diagnostics/52687) to improve `ClangImporter` diagnostics.

> We would like to propose improvements to the ClangImporter to provide more detailed diagnostics when an entity cannot be imported from C or Objective-C. As it stands, when the ClangImporter fails to import an entity (function, type, macro, etc.) either entirely or partially, failure is largely silent. The current Swift compilation errors present largely as if the entity was never defined at all.

[Frederick Kellison-Linn](https://forums.swift.org/u/jumhyn) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-generalize-keypath-to-function-conversions/52681) to generalize keypath-to-function conversions.

> This proposal introduces the ability to use the key path expression `\Root.value` wherever functions of `(Root) -> Value` are allowed.
> 
> Swift-evolution thread: [Key Path Expressions as Functions](https://forums.swift.org/t/key-path-expressions-as-functions/19587)

[Patrick Pijnappel](https://forums.swift.org/u/patrick_pijnappel) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-exhaustive-pattern-matching-for-non-open-classes/52718) to implement exhaustive pattern matching for non-open classes.

> Since we now make the distinction between open and non-open classes, it seems we should be able to make non-open class hierarchies exhaustively matchable. This would be a nice win for compile-time checks in the face of adding a new subclass, without any added syntax.

Guillaume Lessard [pitched](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-pointer-usability-improvements/52736) to improve pointer usability.

> This proposal introduces some quality-of-life improvements for `UnsafePointer` and its `Mutable` and `Raw` variants.
>
> 1.  Add an API to obtain an `UnsafeRawPointer` instance that is advanced to a given alignment from its starting point.
> 2.  Add an API to obtain a pointer to a stored property of an aggregate `T`, given an `UnsafePointer<T>`.
> 3.  Rename the unchecked subscript of `Unsafe[Mutable]Pointer` to include the argument label `unchecked`.
> 4.  Add the ability to compare pointers of any two types.
