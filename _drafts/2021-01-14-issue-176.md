### Podcasts

In [Empower Apps #74](https://www.empowerapps.show/34), [Leo Dion](https://twitter.com/leogdion) and [Tim Condon](https://twitter.com/0xtim) talk about the Swift Server Work Group, SwiftNIO, Server-Side Swift's growth in 2020 and Swift on Server-Side ARM.

### News and community

This newsletter founder [Jesse Squires](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires) wrote a post exploring what type is self in a Swift self-executing anonymous closure used to initialize a stored property. [Nolan Waite](https://bugs.swift.org/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=nolanw) pointed thatthis bug is being tracked at [SR-4559](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4559) and [SR-4865](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-4865).

[Kilo Loco](https://twitter.com/Kilo_Loco) shared a tool [Swift Lambda Maker](https://github.com/Kilo-Loco/SLaM). It is a CLI tool used for creating and packaging AWS Lambda function written in Swift. It can create a new executable Swift Package where you can start coding your Lambda as well as package that Lambda as a zipped Docker image.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0296](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0296-async-await.md): *Async/await* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modification-se-0296-async-await/43318).

> Feedback was very positive on the concept of adding async/await in general with a few key points raised.
> * It was suggested that `try await` reads better than `await try`. The core team agrees, and the proposal will be modified accordingly.
> * There was some discussion of alternatives to `async` (such as `suspends`) which may better describe the meaning. The core team feels that the benefit of sticking with `async` as a term of art with precedent in many other languages was preferable to the the slight descriptive benefit of alternative names. Note that other uses of `async` such as `async let` will be considered in other proposals.
> * Several reviewers expressed concern that it was hard to review this proposal "stand alone", since it interacts so closely with, and its use depends on, other yet-to-be-reviewed proposals. The core team acknowledges this, but feels that this is unavoidable given the large surface area of the whole concurrency feature. To mitigate this, reviewers of subsequent proposals should feel free to revisit parts of accepted concurrency proposals in reviewing those subsequent proposals when they interact.
> * Several reviewers were disappointed about subsetting out getters. The core team wants to be clear that this is just left as a future direction, not ruled out, and as such isn't a reason to hold back on accepting this proposal.
> * In a separate thread to the review, there was some discussion of the necessity of `try` and `await`. The core team does not believe the current requirement to mark throwing calls with `try` should be revisited, and thinks there is a similar need to mark possible suspension points with `await`. The core team would be open to considering future proposals that allow multiple calls needing either `try` or `await` to be sugared somehow (for example, some form of try block).

### Returned proposals

### Rejected proposals

[SE-0292](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0292-package-registry-service.md) has been [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0292-package-registry-service/43402).

> The feedback to the idea of defining an open-standard Package Registry HTTP based API, and implementing support for it in SwiftPM as an alternative to resolving dependencies via git, was very positive.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0290](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0290-negative-availability.md): *Unavailability Condition* is [under a second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-290-second-review-unavailability-condition/43544).

> The _second_ review of [SE-0290, "Unavailability Condition"](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0290-negative-availability.md), begins now and runs through January 12, 2021.  This proposal was [previously returned for revision 1](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0290-unavailability-condition/41873/34).

[SE-0298](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0298-asyncsequence.md): *`Async`/`Await`: Sequences* is [under a review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0298-async-await-sequences/43786).

> Swift's [async/await](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0296-async-await.md) feature provides an intuitive, built-in way to write and use functions that return a single value at some future point in time. We propose building on top of this feature to create an intuitive, built-in way to write and use functions that return many values over time.
>
> This proposal is composed of the following pieces:
> 
> 1. A standard library definition of a protocol that represents an asynchronous sequence of values
> 2. Compiler support to use `for...in` syntax on an asynchronous sequence of values
> 3. A standard library implementation of commonly needed functions that operate on an asynchronous sequence of values

[James Sherlock](https://forums.swift.org/u/sherlouk) first time [pitched](https://forums.swift.org/t/spm-multi-package-repositories/43193) to add support for repositories which contain multiple packages.

> Many developers operate under a "[mono repo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo)" design pattern where code for multiple packages or projects exists under one repository.
>
> Swift Package Manager currently assumes that each repository only contains one package, this may not always be true - this proposal aims to add support for repositories which contain multiple packages.

[Mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) started [a discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/urls-as-swift-package-identifiers/43404) about URLs as Swift package identifiers.

> We believe that using URLs as package identifiers is intuitive and familiar for developers, and will best solve the immediate and future needs of this project.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) [updated](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-2-structured-concurrency/43452) that [Structured Concurrency](https://forums.swift.org/t/concurrency-structured-concurrency/41622) has been revising.

[Jeff Kelley](https://twitter.com/SlaunchaMan) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-sugar-for-preconditions-and-guards/43520) to add sugar for preconditions and guards.

[Chuquimia_Max](https://forums.swift.org/u/chuquimia_max) expressed [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-enum-composition/43598) to add `enum` composition.

> It seems this has _almost_ been discussed [here](https://forums.swift.org/t/enum-inheritance/9933) and [here](https://forums.swift.org/t/enums-as-enum-underlying-types/17375/19) but never with what I would consider to be an intuitive, Swift-esque syntax.
> 
> Essentially, I reckon it would be beneficial to be able to create a composed enum using `&` in the same way protocol composition is currently functioning.
> Composable enums could also be handy if we get typed `throws` in the future: if only enum errors are thrown the compiler could implicitly compose an error enum based on the call stack.

[Joe Groff](https://twitter.com/jckarter) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/concurrency-continuations-for-interfacing-async-tasks-with-synchronous-code/43619) about continuations for interfacing async tasks with synchronous code.

> Asynchronous Swift code needs to be able to work with existing synchronous
code that uses techniques such as completion callbacks and delegate methods to
respond to events. Asynchronous tasks can suspend themselves on
**continuations** which synchronous code can then capture and invoke to
resume the task in response to an event.
