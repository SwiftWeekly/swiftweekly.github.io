I want to thank [Jeroen](https://twitter.com/AppForce1) for helping put with last week's issue. Great job, also spicing up the usual flow. How did you like it? Let us know.

We finally have the [Xcode 12.5 RC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-12_5-release-notes#Swift), and it has some notable Swift language fixes and improvements.

In the last two weeks seems that the Swift core team has woken up after winter sleep. There are now dozens of proposals in review and more returned.

Now let's go to the news!

### Returned proposals

[SE-0305](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0305-package-manager-binary-target-improvements/45589) has been [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0305-package-manager-binary-target-improvements/47441).

> The feedback to idea of extending SwiftPM to support new kind of binary targets, in conjunction with the  plugin system proposed in [SE-0303](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0303-swiftpm-extensible-build-tools.md) was positive. However, given [SE-0303](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0303-swiftpm-extensible-build-tools.md) was returned to review, as well as feedback from reviewers requesting additional details on the structure suggested on [SE-0305](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0305-swiftpm-binary-target-improvements.md), the core team decided to ask that [SE-0305](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0305-swiftpm-binary-target-improvements.md) is refined along side [SE-0303](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0303-swiftpm-extensible-build-tools.md).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0306](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0306-actors.md): *Actors* is [under the second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0306-second-review-actors/47291).

> The core team sees two competing draws for consistency here—first, as Chris notes, in other places where Swift models API design, `let` is externally treated equivalently with a get-only `var`, and by that principle, actors should follow suit and not expose `let`s as implicitly `nonisolated` outside of the actor even if they are immutable. That would reserve for the actor the ability to evolve the interface into an internally-mutable variable, or get-only computed property, without breaking API or ABI. It would also result in a consistent rule for how `isolated` and `nonisolated` apply to actor members; instead of `let`s being a special case, _any_ actor declaration would require `nonisolated` to be explicitly annotated in order to declare it as safe to access from outside the actor without isolation.
> 
> On the other hand, "`let`s are immutable and safe to share across threads" has also been a common message through Swift's history, and it could seem boilerplatey to require an explicit annotation on top of `let` in order to say that, yes, this immutable value is actually immutable. If actors in practice end up carrying a lot of immutable state, the annotation burden could be onerous. The core team would like to hear from the community, particularly adopters who have experimented with actors, to get more signal about how much burden treating the isolation `let`s equivalently with other declarations will be in practice.

[SE-0310](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0310-effectful-readonly-properties.md): *Effectful Read-only Properties* is [under a review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0310-effectful-read-only-properties/47401).

> Nominal types such as classes, structs, and enums in Swift support [computed properties](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html) and [subscripts](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Subscripts.html), which are members of the type that invoke programmer-specified computations when getting or setting them.  The recently accepted proposal [SE-0296](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0296-async-await.md) introduced asynchronous functions via `async`, in conjunction with `await`, but did not specify that computed properties or subscripts can support effects like asynchrony.  Furthermore, to take full advantage of `async` properties, the ability to specify that a property `throws` is also important.

[SE-0305](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0305-swiftpm-binary-target-improvements.md): *Package Manager Binary Target Improvements* is [under the second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0305-2nd-review-package-manager-binary-target-improvements/47439).

> The Swift Package Manager’s binaryTarget type lets packages vend libraries that either cannot be built in Swift Package Manager for technical reasons, or for which the source code cannot be published for legal or other reasons.
>
> In the current version of SwiftPM, binary targets only support libraries in an Xcode-oriented format called XCFramework, and only for Apple platforms.

[SE-0303](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0303-swiftpm-extensible-build-tools.md): *Package Manager Extensible Build Tools* is [under the second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0303-2nd-review-package-manager-extensible-build-tools/47438).

> This is a proposal for extensible build tools support in Swift Package Manager. The initial set of functionality is intentionally basic, and focuses on a general way of allowing build tool plugins to add commands to the build graph. The approach is to:
>
> * provide a scalable way for packages to define plugins that can provide build-related capabilities
> * support a narrowly scoped initial set of possible capabilities that plugins can provide
>
> The set of possible capabilities can then be extended in future SwiftPM versions. The goal is to provide short-term support for common tasks such as source code generation, with a design that can scale to more complex tasks in the future.
>
> This proposal depends on improvements to the existing Binary Target type in SwiftPM — those details are the subject of the separate proposal [SE-0305](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0305-swiftpm-binary-target-improvements.md).

[SE-0311](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0311-task-locals.md): *Task-local values* is [under a review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0311-task-local-values/47478).

> This proposal is part of the larger [concurrency feature](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-concurrency-roadmap/41611).  There have been quite a lot of these reviews, and there are a quite a few more coming,  I'm afraid; still, we seem to have gotten through most of the more difficult ones.  Thank you for your patience with all this.

[SE-0309](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0309-unlock-existential-types-for-all-protocols.md): *Unlock existential types for all protocols* is [under a review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0309-unlock-existential-types-for-all-protocols/47515).

> Swift allows one to use a protocol as a type when its _requirements_ meet a rather unintuitive list of criteria, among which is the absence of associated type requirements, and emits the following error otherwise: `Protocol can only be used as a generic constraint because it has 'Self' or associated type requirements`. Our objective is to _alleviate_ this limitation so as to impact only the ability to access certain members (instead of preemptively sealing off the entire protocol interface), and adjust the specified criteria to further reduce the scope of the restriction.
> 
> This proposal is a preamble to a series of changes aimed at generalizing value-level abstraction (existentials) and improving its interaction with type-level abstraction (generics). For an in-depth exploration of the relationships among different built-in abstractions models, we recommend reading the [design document for improving the UI of the generics model](https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-ui-of-generics/22814).

### Swift Forums

[Tim Vermeulen](https://forums.swift.org/u/timv) pitched a proposal to add `indexed()` and `Collection` conformances for `enumerated()` and `zip(_:_:)`.

> This proposal aims to fix the lack of `Collection` conformance of the sequences returned by `zip(_:_:)` and `enumerated()`, preventing them from being used in a context that requires a `Collection`. Also included is the addition of the `indexed()` method on `Collection` as a more ergonomic, efficient, and correct alternative to `c.enumerated()` and `zip(c.indices, c)`.

[Jonathan G.](https://forums.swift.org/u/1oo7) started an interesting discussion about making official the "Undocumented/Private API" signifier `_`.

> There is an undocumented convention in Swift, of appending an underscore "_" to a public symbol or attribute in order to communicate some special meaning.
>
> However, you will not find any mention of this practice within Swift's own documentation on [swift.org](http://swift.org/), nor any explanation of the often subtle differences in meaning of "_". (Please correct me if I'm wrong. I did several searches and came up with nothing, and several read-throughs.)

[Kelvin Ma](https://github.com/kelvin13) started [a discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/why-is-dictionary-position-not-settable/47435) about why is `Dictionary[position:]` not settable?

> the `Dictionary` type exposes a non-nil subscript [`[position:]`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary/2831255-subscript) which takes a `Dictionary.Index`. i always wondered why this subscript is `get`-only, since i often find myself wanting to check if a key-value pair is present in the dictionary, and then mutate the value only if it exists.
