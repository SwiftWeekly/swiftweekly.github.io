Not only did the Swift repository pass [18,000](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/1019623101921804288) pull requests (after the internal repository had 18,000 SVN revisions after four years), it also celebrated its [8th birthday](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/1021627717228220417)! Impressive numbers, and may many more follow.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-8252](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8252) [Compiler] Consolidate and Fix `-debug-crash-*` Flags
- [SR-8253](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8253) [Compiler] `catch` clause should allow multiple patterns
- [SR-8327](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8327) [Package Manager] Improve error message when bootstrapping SwiftPM without cmake or ninja

### Swift Unwrapped

Jesse and JP are taking [a well deserved summer break](https://twitter.com/swift_unwrapped/status/1016334803648434176). ☀️🏖

### News and community

[Cory Benfield](https://github.com/Lukasa) announced the release of [`NIOTransportServices`](https://forums.swift.org/t/niotransportservices-swiftnio-and-network-framework/14567) to help users use Network.framework with a SwiftNIO API.

### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/18082) that continues the work of SE-0002 (!), removing multiple parameter lists from the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

[Ben Cohen](https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift/) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/18098) that refactors some code making use of conditional conformances. The result? +276, -2,694 lines of code. Impressive!

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0215](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0215-conform-never-to-hashable-and-equatable.md): *Conform `Never` to `Equatable` and `Hashable`* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0215-conform-never-to-equatable-and-hashable/13586/45).

> The Core Team discussed the review, and reached the following conclusions:
>
> - The proposal should be accepted with the new explicit conformances to `Equatable` and `Hashable` be added to `Never`. This addresses a real point of friction users are experiencing with the use of `Never`.
>
> - For the same reasons conformances to `Hashable` and `Equatable` are being added to `Never`, the Core Team felt that conformances to `Error` and `Comparable` should also be added to `Never` as part of accepting this proposal. Both of these additional protocol conformances were brought up during the review.
>
> - `Never` should become a blessed bottom type in the language. This matches with semantics in other languages and its intended role in Swift.
>
> With respect to the latter, the Core Team discussed what Never being a bottom type actually meant. From that discussion we reached the following conclusions:
>
> - Semantically, as a bottom type, it would mean that Never should be implicitly convertible to any other type. This composes well in the type system because of the fact that instances of `Never` cannot be instantiated.
>
> However, being a bottom type does not imply that `Never` should implicitly conform to all protocols. Instead, convenient protocol conformances for Never should be added as deemed useful or necessary.

[SE-0218](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0218-introduce-compact-map-values.md): *Introduce `compactMapValues` to Dictionary* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0218-introduce-compactmapvalues-to-dictionary/14448).

> Feedback on the proposal was very positive – the main concern being with the name, but this falls naturally out of our existing method names so is consistent, if clunky.

[SE-0219](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0219-package-manager-dependency-mirroring.md): *Package Manager Dependency Mirroring* was [accepted with revisions](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0219-package-manager-dependency-mirroring/14371/8).

> The review of SE-0219 “Package Manager Dependency Mirroring" ran from July 10...17. Feedback was positive, and the proposal is accepted with revisions (adding a `swift package config get-mirror` command). Thanks to everyone who participated!

### Rejected proposals

[SE-0217](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0217-bangbang.md): *Introducing the `!!` "Unwrap or Die" operator to the Swift Standard Library* was [rejected](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0217-the-unwrap-or-die-operator/14107/222).

> The core team has decided to reject this proposal as written. However, the core team concurs that the motivating problems posed by the proposal are important to solve, as did an overwhelming majority of commenters who participated in the public review. The fact that the only fixit the compiler offers to unwrap an Optional is to use the `!` operator is an unfortunate legacy of the Swift 1.0 days, before anything in the SDKs Swift was designed to work with had been audited for nullability, so force-unwrapping was far more of a necessity. Nowadays this legacy is actively harmful, and encourages bad habits in new Swift programmers, as the proposal and review discussion highlight extensively. It is clear too that `!` giving inadequate runtime feedback is a major problem, since a large contingent of the Swift community follows style guides that flat-out ban it, and the `guard ... else { fatalError("message") }` idiom is widespread as a way of more thoughtfully crashing on nil with an actionable error message.

I'd encourage you to read [the rest of the rationale](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0217-the-unwrap-or-die-operator/14107/222).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0221](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0221-character-properties.md): *Character Properties* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0221-character-properties/14686).

> [Tony Allevato](https://github.com/allevato) (a co-author here) proposed [Add Unicode Properties to `Unicode.Scalar`](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0211-unicode-scalar-properties.md), which exposes Unicode properties from the [Unicode Character Database](http://unicode.org/reports/tr44/). These are Unicode expert/enthusiast oriented properties that give a finer granularity of control and answer highly-technical and specific Unicody enquiries.
>
> However, they are not ergonomic and Swift makes no attempt to clarify their interpretation or usage: meaning and proper interpretation is directly tied to the Unicode Standard and the version of Unicode available at run time. There’s some low-hanging ergo-fruit ripe for picking by exposing properties directly on `Character`.

### Swift Forums

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r) shared news about some [recently added features](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-manifest-caching-landed/14624) in SwiftPM, namely the caching of manifests.

> [..] SwiftPM will now cache the loaded manifests for effectively all operations except dependency resolution. This provides great performance improvements during iterative development. Commands like `swift build`, `swift test`, `swift package edit`, `swift package generate-xcodeproj` should start significantly faster once the cache is created. For e.g., time spent to load all manifests of Vapor reduces from 3.7s to 64ms!
