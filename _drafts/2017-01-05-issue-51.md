### News and community

Apple's holiday period ended on January 3rd. The `master` branch lock was released, CI buildbots returned online, and Apple employees [merged](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/816525308580929536) over 30 pull requests that had piled up over the break.

### Commits and pull requests

Slava Pestov [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6133) evolution proposal [SE-0110](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0110-distingish-single-tuple-arg.md): *Distinguish between single-tuple and multiple-argument function types*. This is the first implemented proposal for Swift 4. 🎉

Brian Gesiak [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6495) colorized output for `-dump-parse` and `-dump-ast`.

Brian Gesiak [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6513) a pull request that marks functions that can return twice, such as `vfork` and `setjmp`, unavailable in Swift. Swift code that used those functions would almost certainly crash.

Brian Gesiak [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6530) a pull request that adds support for importing "function-like" macros from C and Objective-C. For now, only function-like macros that take no arguments, such as `#define MyMacro() 1`, are imported.
