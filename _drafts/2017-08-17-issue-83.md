### Commits and pull requests

String/Substring.CharacterView is marked as deprecated by [merge request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11425) from [Michael Ilseman](https://github.com/milseman). Moving from Swift 3.2 to Swift 4 could be a little bit easier now. 
> This also allows us to schedule the unbreaking of String.CharacterView leakiness without a hard source break.

[Arnold Schwaighofer](https://github.com/aschwaighofer) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11437) a memory leak in _cocoaStringSlice. 

[Robert Widmann](https://github.com/CodaFi) opened [merge request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11087) in addition to [discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170717/004953.html) on mailing list to fully remove SwiftExperimental library. Merge request is waiting for approve. If you have ideas how to transform SwiftExperimental into something new and useful - don't be shy! 

> SwiftExperimental has sat untouched except for passing committers that need to alter parts of its implementation for language changes. I would like to remove this library and target from the project, but first I’d like to solicit opinions about this change.  In particular, if there are any users of the library, I’d like to know.
