Things have certainly been more quiet than usual as all excited about Swift 5 development beginning from last week. Some bugs are fixed, improvements done, on mailing list existing topics discussions are continued and one more "planing request" is started.

### Starter tasks

- [SR-5674](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5674): Add fix-it for computed 'let' declaration".

### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 24: [ABI Stability - Mangling](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/81026). In continuation of previous episodes of ABI Stability this one discloses interesting topic why exactly Swift needs names mangling and how it's differ from C and Objective-C.

### News and community

[Mike Ash](https://www.mikeash.com) wrote really great and expressed post on his blog, [Friday Q&A 2017-08-11: Swift.Unmanaged](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2017-08-11-swiftunmanaged.html), describing the way Swift converts object references to and from raw C pointers. He gave us good overview of this task in general, divided API usage by memory management requirements (depends on object ownership) and gave good patterns examples for Synchronous Callback, Asynchronous One-Shot Callback and Asynchronous Multi-Shot Callback.

> Getting Swift references into and out of the world of C encompasses two separate tasks. The first task is converting a reference into the raw bytes for a void *, or converting the raw bytes of a void * back to a reference.

> The second task is making Swift's memory management work with a pointer that Swift can't see. 

### Commits and pull requests

String/Substring.CharacterView is marked as deprecated by [merge request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11425) from [Michael Ilseman](https://github.com/milseman). Moving from Swift 3.2 to Swift 4 could be a little bit easier now. 
> This also allows us to schedule the unbreaking of String.CharacterView leakiness without a hard source break.

[Arnold Schwaighofer](https://github.com/aschwaighofer) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11437) a memory leak in _cocoaStringSlice. 

[Robert Widmann](https://github.com/CodaFi) opened [merge request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11087) in addition to [discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170717/004953.html) on mailing list to fully remove SwiftExperimental library. Merge request is waiting for approve. If you have ideas how to transform SwiftExperimental into something new and useful - don't be shy! 

> SwiftExperimental has sat untouched except for passing committers that need to alter parts of its implementation for language changes. I would like to remove this library and target from the project, but first I’d like to solicit opinions about this change. In particular, if there are any users of the library, I’d like to know.

Robert Widmann [SR-5671: Emit diagnostic in place of collection downcast in pattern](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11441) to resolve [compiler error](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5671) for downcasting inside switch case from array of parent objects to array of child objects.

> - This should compile.

[Slava Pestov](https://github.com/slavapestov) [made](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11462) improvement to Swift Intermediate Language: mark vtable entries as inherited or overridden in corresponding cases. 

Implementation of Swift libSyntax API is [started](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11320). Aim: provide all features of the C++ libSyntax API, but exposed to Swift.

[SR-5677: Error message for inapplicable command line options could be clearer](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5677) has a merged PR, so the status of this improvement now is closed. So, if you invoke some CLI options from 'swiftc' to 'swift' you'll get more descriptive message than previously. 

### Proposals

[SE-0185](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0185-synthesize-equatable-hashable.md): *Synthesizing `Equatable` and `Hashable` conformance* by Tony Allevato [got 'Accepted' status](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170814/038854.html).

> Feedback for the feature was glowingly positive, and the proposal is accepted.  The core team discussed the concerns raised in the feedback thread for the proposal.
> [...]
>
> - The core team feels that adding compiler magic for this case is reasonable because it solves an important user need, and doesn’t preclude the introduction of a more general feature (e.g. like a macro system, or Rust's ‘deriving’ feature) in the future. [...]
>
> - The code synthesized is meant to feel like a default implementation that you’re getting for free from a (constrained) extension on the protocol. This is why conformance to the protocol itself is all that is required, not something like “AutoEquatable”.

You can still [follow this page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) for all proposals updates.

### Mailing lists

Daryle Walker wants to figure out on [mailing list](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170724/038297.html) if adding “constexpr” facility from C++ into Swift could be a part of Swift's history.

> The facility is a key step for value-based generic parameters (and fixed-size arrays if you don’t want to be stuck with integer literals for bounds).

### Finally

How did we live without [it](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/897150073296928768)?
