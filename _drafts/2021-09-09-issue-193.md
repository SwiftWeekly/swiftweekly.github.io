### News and community

[John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) wrote [an article](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/conditional-compilation-within-swift-expressions/) explaining conditional compilation within Swift expressions.

### Commits and pull requests

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/39051) that adds an option to build the concurrency library for back deployment.

[Alex Hoppen](https://github.com/ahoppen) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/pull/414) that implements semantic highlighting for Swift.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0321](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0321-package-registry-publish.md) *Package Registry Service - Publish Endpoint* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0321-package-registry-service-publish-endpoint/51660).

### Returned proposals

[SE-0320](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0320-codingkeyrepresentable.md) has been [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0320-coding-of-non-string-int-keyed-dictionary-into-a-keyedcontainer/51706).

> The feedback from the review was positive, and members of the community suggested several improvements that the author and core team felt would be good to adopt:
>
> 1.  Adding conformance for `String` and `Int` to `CodingKeyRepresentable` which will allow the natural use of `String` and `Int` keys when `CodingKeyRepresentable` is used as a generic constraint.
> 2.  Make the initializer of the `CodingKeyRepresentable` protocol be generic.
> 3.  Provide default implementations for the conformance for `RawRepresentable` (with `String` and `Int` raw values).
> 4.  Make the initializers of the internal `_DictionaryCodingKey` non-failable.

### Swift Forums

[Michael Verges](https://github.com/maustinstar) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitching-optional-throws-in-swift/51650) to add optional throws in Swift.

> There are many cases when jurisdiction of error handling is unclear. Developers may question whether to handle or propogate errors.
> 
> Choosing to throw errors provides the benefit that callers can flexibly handle problems.
> 
> Choosing to not throw errors provides the benefit of simplifying syntax to users (no `do-try-catch`).

Karl [informed](https://forums.swift.org/t/api-changes-for-0-2-0/51647) about [WebURL](https://karwa.github.io/swift-url/) version 0.2.0.

> I'm getting ready to release version 0.2.0 of WebURL. It's going to be an exciting and important release, including a `WebURLSystemExtras` module for integration with `System.framework` and the `swift-system` package, and aligning the project with the very latest revision of the URL Standard.

[Patrick Goley](https://forums.swift.org/u/patrickgoley) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-destructuring-assignment-of-structs-and-classes/51593) to add destructuring assignment of structs and classes.

> Destructuring assignment is a language feature that allows you to extract multiple parts of a value and assign them to multiple variables within a single assignment statement.

[Steve Canon](https://twitter.com/stephentyrone) [announced](https://forums.swift.org/t/1-0-0-release-notes/51641) that the [first stable release](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics/releases/tag/1.0.0) of Swift Numerics has been released.

Austin started [conversaion](https://forums.swift.org/t/netlink-socket-support-in-swiftnio/51651) about netlink socket support in SwiftNIO.

[Konrad `ktoso` Malawski](https://forums.swift.org/u/ktoso) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-distributed-actors/51669) to implement distributed actors.

> With the recent introduction of Swift concurrency, and most notably actors to the language, Swift gained powerful and foundational building blocks for expressing _thread-safe_ concurrent programs. This proposal aims to extend Swift's actors with the ability to work equally well for distributed systems thanks to the introduction of _distributed actors_ and _location transparency_ associated with them.

[Max Desiatov](https://twitter.com/maxdesiatov) [informed](https://forums.swift.org/t/swiftwasm-5-4-0-has-been-released/51753) that [SwiftWasm 5.4.0 21](https://github.com/swiftwasm/swift/releases/tag/swift-wasm-5.4.0-RELEASE) is out.

> This release matches upstream Swift 5.4, and allows you to compile Swift apps (as long as they don't use code specific to other platforms) to WebAssembly, and even run them in the browser.

[elsh](https://forums.swift.org/u/elsh) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-module-aliasing/51737) to add module aliasing support.

> As Swift libraries and packages are more widely distributed, module names sometimes end up clashing. As thereâ€™s no module namespace yet in Swift, libraries are often forced to be renamed or pinned to an older non-conflicting version in such case. This makes use cases such as the following challenging:
> 
> * Adding a new dependency or upgrading as it can introduce a collision: A new (or upgraded) module can have the same name as another module already in the dependency graph. Module name Logging is a common example.
> 
> * Upgrading to a newer version of a package from an older version pinned by an upstream library: Consider a scenario where MyApp depends on module Lib, and Lib depends on module Logging. MyApp also depends on Logging. If Lib is pinned to Logging 1.0.0, MyApp is stuck with the same version 1.0.0.
