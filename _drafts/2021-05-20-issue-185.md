### Accepted proposals

[SE-0313](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0313-improved-control-over-actor-isolation/47813/35) *Improved control over actor isolation* was [accepted with revisions](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-revisions-se-0313-improved-control-over-actor-isolation/48573).

> The core team (with discussion with the proposal authors) has decided to accept a subset of the proposal. The revised (and accepted) proposal has the following parts removed:
>
> * Support for multiple **isolated** parameters
> * The proposed changes for closure isolation control
>
> The removed parts, which were the most controversial sources in the review discussion, can be revisited in a future Swift Evolution proposal.
> 
> The review discussion also discussed the tradeoffs between a syntax-driven versus type-driven approach. The core team discussed the tradeoffs of the two methods and observed that a type-based approach would (by design) pervade the type system and potentially result in a more complicated system. The core team thus preferred the syntax-based approach in the proposal.

### Returned proposals

[SE-0292](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0292-2nd-review-package-registry-service) has been [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0292-package-registry-service/48338).

> Before diving into further details, the core team would like to acknowledge it took unusual long time to provide feedback to this proposal given Swift's concurrency model proposals, which taken precedence over other proposals including SE-0292. The core team would like to thank the authors of SE-0292 for their patience and reiterate the importance of SE-0292, especially given its potential role in defining how Swift module disambiguation could work.
> 
> Most reviewers, as well as the core team, felt the 2nd iteration made significant progress towards acceptance. With that said, the core team would like to see the following points addressed before putting the proposal into a narrowly scoped third review.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0314](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0314-async-stream.md): *AsyncStream and AsyncThrowingStream* is [under a review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0314-asyncstream-and-asyncthrowingstream/48198).

> The continuation types added in [SE-0300](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0300-continuation.md) act as adaptors for synchronous code that signals completion by calling a delegate method or callback function. For code that instead yields multiple values over time, this proposal adds new types to support implementing an `AsyncSequence` interface.

[SE-0306](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0306-actors.md): *Actors and `nonisolated let`* [amendment](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/1354/files) is [under a review](https://forums.swift.org/t/amendment-se-0306-actors-and-nonisolated-let/48386).

> This amendment is motivated by having more hands-on experience incrementally adopting actors into an existing app. Immutable object state is very common, and as originally accepted, the proposal requires even immutable `let` properties in actors to be treated as actor-isolated unless explicitly marked `isolated`. The proposal authors feel that in practice this creates too heavy of an annotation burden when turning existing code into actor code, since every immutable  value must either be marked `nonisolated` or `await`-ed everywhere. There were however legitimate concerns about library evolution in the original review if `public let`s would be implicitly exported as nonisolated by default, since that would limit the library author's ability to turn the declarations into locally-mutable state or computed properties with isolated computation in the future. This amendment seeks to balance the competing considerations by allowing `let` properties on actors to be accessed without isolation locally within a module, but not across modules unless the declaration is explicitly `nonisolated`.

### Swift Forums

[Craig Hockenberry](https://twitter.com/chockenberry) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/lets-fix-if-let-syntax/48188) to fix `if let` syntax.

[Kaitlin Mahar](https://twitter.com/k__mahar) updated us about Swift on the [Server Workgroup April 28, 2021 meeting notes](https://forums.swift.org/t/april-28-2021/48265).

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) [informed](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-2-global-actors/48332) that he updated the [revision](https://github.com/DougGregor/swift-evolution/blob/global-actors/proposals/nnnn-global-actors.md) of the global actors proposal.

> Changes from the first pitch include:
>
> * Clarify that the types of global-actor-qualified functions are global-actor-qualified.
> * State that global-actor-qualified types are Sendable
> * Expand on the implicit conversion rules for function types
> * Require global and static variables to be immutable & non-isolated or global-actor-qualified.
> * Describe the relationship between global actors and instance actors
> * Update inference rules for global actors  

[Konrad Malawski](https://twitter.com/ktosopl) [updated](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-3-async-let/48336) the `async let` [proposal](https://github.com/ktoso/swift-evolution/blob/d44f5dc31fa91c7e029ae9c17a5256af0c1a91aa/proposals/mmmm-async-let.md) with the latest semantics and spelling details.

> This is the first pitch of the feature as a stand-alone thing, it was previously pitched as part of structured concurrency [pitch #1 3](https://forums.swift.org/t/concurrency-structured-concurrency/41622), and [pitch #2](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-2-structured-concurrency/43452) and was separated out later on as it's a feature large enough to deserve it's own discussion.
>
> Changes since the original pitch are mostly focused around additional discussion and details around exact semantics of the feature, e.g. we added:
>
> * longer discussion of throwing semantics
>   * this is an area we'd welcome discussion of. I.e. currently if an async let has a throwing initializer, and is _not_ awaited explicitly, the task is awaited on implicitly but the thrown error is silently dropped. This is equivalent to TaskGroup semantics and in line with "since you didn't await on it, you clearly don't care about it" however it may have some tricky implications.
> * more details about cancellation handling

[Igor Makarov](https://forums.swift.org/u/igor-makarov) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/allow-calling-type-members-from-instance-members-without-self/48389) to allow calling type members from instance members without `Self.`.

> Following up on the [previous discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/modifier-to-make-a-func-on-a-type-a-free-function/47749), I wanted to refine my suggestion with the one [Svein proposed](https://forums.swift.org/t/modifier-to-make-a-func-on-a-type-a-free-function/47749/18).
> 
> Make the prefix `Self.` non-required when calling a type member (`static` or `class`) from an instance member. This can apply to botb methods and properties.

[Adam Fowler](https://twitter.com/o_aberration) [explained](https://forums.swift.org/t/about-the-soto-category/48509/2) how Swift SDK for AWS exactly works.

> Soto is a third party Swift SDK for Amazon Web Services (AWS). The library provides access to all AWS services and works on Linux, macOS and iOS.
> 
> Soto is heavily integrated with a number of Swift on Server packages including AsyncHTTPClient, SwiftNIO, Logging, Metrics and is primarily targeted for Swift on Server. All the API calls are designed to be called in an asynchronous manner to avoid blocking your current thread.
>
> Even though it isn't the primary target we have still put in a fair amount of work to ensure the library works on iOS and will continue to ensure this is the case.

[Richard Venable](https://forums.swift.org/u/rvenable) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-enum-case-inferencing/48536) about enum case inferencing.

> I was reading the discussion on [Let’s fix `if let` syntax](https://forums.swift.org/t/lets-fix-if-let-syntax). It's a good discussion, but it overlooks how weird Swift is to encourage us to create variables that replace existing variables but with a different type (optional type replaced with non-optional type). `let x = x` is a weird pattern, but we are all just accustomed to it.
> 
> Meanwhile, the proposal to just use `if x != nil { }` is not getting enough attention. There was an [objection](https://forums.swift.org/t/lets-fix-if-let-syntax/48188/12) saying "I find it really weird that merely performing a comparison would change the type of a variable from optional to non-optional." But what if we weren't changing the type of a variable? What if it is the _same variable_ - the Swift compiler just infers what we want to do with it based on prior knowledge.
