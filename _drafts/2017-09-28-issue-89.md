### Starter tasks

Starter tasks are a great way to get started with contributing to Swift. Ask questions right in the bug reporting system, and get feedback when you submit your pull request.

* [SR-5996](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5996): Improve compiler error with a fix-it: Cannot assign to value, 'bar' is a 'let' constant
* [SR-5995](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5995): update-checkout --tags should fetch --tags before attempting to find a tag
* [SR-5983](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5983): Unused result warning phrasing is worse for closures than normal functions
* [SR-5982](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5982): didSet causes unwanted calls to getter even when oldValue isn't used

### Swift Unwrapped

in [Episode 30](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/87409) hosts Jese Squires and JP Simard with Mike Ash discussed changes in weak references implementation in Swift 4.

### News and community
We can celebrate 10th LLVM [anniversary](https://twitter.com/llvmorg/status/912724943221096448)ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ. Project that makes Swift exists. Keep it up, [LLVM](http://llvm.org).

Mike Ash [wrote](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2017-09-22-swift-4-weak-references.html) great post about changes in Swift weak references implementation from 4th version of language.

> Weak references are an important language feature. Swift's original implementation was wonderfully clever and had some nice properties, but also had some problems. By adding an optional side table, Swift's engineers were able to solve those problems while keeping the nice, clever properties of the original. The side table implementation also opens up a lot of possibilities for great new features in the future.

[Ahmed Sulaiman](https://medium.com/@ahmedsulaiman) wrote descriptive [blog post: Debugging Swift code with LLDB](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/debugging-swift-code-with-lldb-b30c5cf2fd49) about using lldb in general and some unpopular tricks with Swift debugging. You can enhance your debugging skills with it.
