Kristaps has asked me to take over the writing for this week. It seems that Swift proposals and pitches have slowed down a little bit for now. Is this due to summer in the northern hemisphere or people having fun with the current beta releases by Apple? Who knows. I do know everything happens in cycles and my guess is that things will pick up again. Enjoy this week's links and information.

* [SR-14824](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-14883) [Compiler] Consider `must` in diagnostic error message for empty `switch` cases

### News and community

[Bruno Rocha](https://twitter.com/rockbruno_) wrote an in depth article on [How Actors Work Internally in Swift](https://swiftrocks.com/how-actors-work-internally-in-swift/).

[Tim Condon](https://twitter.com/0xTim) did a nice experiment with Visual Studio Code as a (server-side) Swift IDE. [He reports on his experience in a Swift Forum topic.](https://twitter.com/0xTim/status/1412775961343442954)

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0292](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0292-package-registry-service.md) *Package Registry Service* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-with-modifications-se-0292-package-registry-service/49849).

The [3rd review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0292-3rd-review-package-registry-service/) of [SE-0292](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0292-package-registry-service.md) has concluded. The review has been generally quiet with feedback focused on making the OpenAPI spec more robust to explicitly highlight the support for redirecting proxies which have been one of the focus points of the [2nd review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0292-2nd-review-package-registry-service/). As such, the proposal has been accepted with a few minor revisions.

[SE-0319](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0319-never-identifiable.md): *Never as Identifiable* [amendment](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/1399) [was under review and is accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0319-never-as-identifiable/50246).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0314](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0314-async-stream.md): *AsyncStream and AsyncThrowingStream* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0314-second-review-asyncstream-and-asyncthrowingstream/49803).

[SE-0304](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0319-never-identifiable.md): *Structured Concurrency* is [under a fourth review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0304-4th-review-structured-concurrency/50281).

### Swift Forums

[Tomer Doron](https://forums.swift.org/u/tomerd) shared the Swift Server Work Group [June 23rd, 2021](https://forums.swift.org/t/june-23rd-2021/50273) meeting notes.

[Dario Rexin](https://twitter.com/drexin) has [announced](https://forums.swift.org/t/development-open-for-swift-5-4-3-for-linux-and-windows/50302) that development for Swift 5.4.3 for Linux and Windows is now open.

> Merge window open: Jul 8 2021 (now)
> Merge window close: Jul 28 2021
> Planned release: End of July or early August 2021

[Ben Cohen](https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/add-value-property-to-result/50253) on value properties on Results.

> [SE-0310](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0310-effectful-readonly-properties.md) added throwing properties, and so [SE-0304](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0304-structured-concurrency.md)
has a throwing value instead of `get()`. This adds a matching equivalent to `Result` which makes things more consistent.
