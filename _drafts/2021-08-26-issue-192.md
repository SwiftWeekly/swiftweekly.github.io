This week I spoke at the [360iDev](https://360idev.com/) conference. I enjoy going to conferences and meeting fellow community members, but it is tough to do it in a remote environment. The organizers did a tremendous job to facilitate both worlds this year. Thank you!

The last two weeks were relatively silent in the open-source Swift world. But we have news that one of the maintainers of this newsletter, [Bas Broek](https://twitter.com/basthomas), might [join](https://twitter.com/basthomas/status/1429113333748224000) this project in the future. :) If you want to participate by helping out or writing an issue, just reach out to us. This is by no means a personal project.

We have free spaces for sponsors on upcoming dates. Your support would be greatly appreciated by more than 10K Twitter followers and 4.5K newsletter subscribers. Head down to [here](https://swiftweeklybrief.com/sponsorship/) to learn more about how you could support this project. Thank you!

### Podcasts

In [episode 103](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/103/) of the Swift by Sundell podcast, [Antoine van der Lee](https://twitter.com/twannl), creator of SwiftLee, joins [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) to discuss the new language features that are being introduced as part of Swift 5.5 — from the brand new concurrency system, to convenience features and various improvements.

### News and community

It turns out that Xcode has documentation for its [minimum requirements and supported SDKs](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/#minimum-requirements).

[Antoine van der Lee](https://www.twitter.com/twannl) wrote [a blog post](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/unwrap-or-throw/) exploring unwrap or throw solutions in Swift.

[Leonardo Maia Pugliese](https://twitter.com/Leo_Pugliese) posted [a brilliant blog post](https://holyswift.app/how-to-do-apis-constraints-with-available-in-swift) about how to do APIs constraints with `@Available` in Swift.

[John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) wrote [an article](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/using-an-unknown-default-case-within-a-switch-statement/) explaining how to use `@unknown default` within switch statements.

[Bas Broek](https://www.twitter.com/basthomas) wrote [a post](https://www.basbroek.nl/deprecating-workarounds) exploring how to deprecate workarounds in Swift.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0321](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0321-package-registry-publish.md): *Package Registry Service - Publish Endpoint* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0321-package-registry-service-publish-endpoint/51286).

> A package registry is responsible for determining which package releases are made available to a consumer.
> 
> Currently, the availability of a package release is determined by an out-of-band process. For example, a registry may consult an index of public Swift packages and make releases available for each tag with a valid version number.
> 
> Having a standard endpoint for publishing a new release to a package registry would empower maintainers to distribute their software and promote interoperability across service providers.

### Swift Forums

[Dimitri Racordon](https://forums.swift.org/u/alvae) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-protocols-with-private-fields/51209) to implement protocols with private fields.

> In a protocol, all fields (properties and methods) will get the access visibility of the conforming type. For instance, conforming to a protocol with a public type will prompt all of its requirements to be public.

[Evan Wilde](https://forums.swift.org/u/etcwilde) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-revisit-the-semantics-of-async-main/51254) to revisit the semantics of async main.

> * The main function should run synchronously up to the first suspension point.
> * The main function should be run on the main actor
> * MainActor should provide a user-specifiable alternative to the default runloop behaviour.
> * Make the main task pull the priority from `getCurrentThreadPriority` instead of a hard-coded `Default` priority.

[Anders Bertelrud](https://forums.swift.org/u/abertelrud) proposed amending to SE-0303: *Plugin API to Use `@main` for Plugin Entry Point*.

> I'd like to propose amending SE-0303 so that SwiftPM plugins use `@main` instead of top-level code for entry points. While it's a little more verbose, this would allow customized entry points for each kind of plugin, and would also make it clearer what the inputs and expected outputs of each plugin are.

[Jeremy Saklad](https://forums.swift.org/u/saklad5) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/allow-use-of-concrete-associated-type-of-protocols/51277) that would allow use of concrete associated type of protocols.

[Karoy Lorentey](https://twitter.com/lorentey) announced Swift Collections [version 1.0](https://forums.swift.org/t/announcement-planning-for-swift-collections-v1-0/51321).

[Konrad `ktoso` Malawski](https://forums.swift.org/u/ktoso) posted Swift Server Workgroup [August 4th 2021 meeting notes](https://forums.swift.org/t/august-4th-2021/51315).

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-staging-in-sendable-checking/51341) to implement Staging in `Sendable` checking.

> [SE-0302](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0302-concurrent-value-and-concurrent-closures.md) introduced the `Sendable` protocol, which is used to indicate which types have values that can safely be copied across actors or, more generally, into any context where a copy of the value might be used concurrently with the original. Applied uniformly to all Swift code, `Sendable` checking eliminates a large class of data races caused by shared mutable state. Swift 5.5 does not perform complete checking for `Sendable` because doing so resulted in so many compiler errors and diagnostics that it undermined the usability of the feature.
> 
> I think we can stage in `Sendable` checking to improve data-race safety over time without. We propose two principles to guide the design of staged `Sendable` checking:
> 
> * Incremental adoption of concurrency should introduce incrementally more `Sendable` checking.
> * `Sendable` problems outside of the user's module should not block progress nor produce an undue annotation burden.

[Aura Lily Vulcano](https://forums.swift.org/u/millenomi) [pitched](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-the-cstdlib-module/51373) a new module offered by Swift by default.

> The module would re-export the correct module that contains the POSIX or POSIX-like C standard library for the current platform, if any; it would _not_ be imported by default, but would allow "reasonably cross-platform" code to avoid using lengthy `#if canImport(…)` chains to gain access to all possible stdlibs, given that they have different names on different OSs.
> 
> For example, the module may be named `CStdlib`.

Robert Widmann (aka [@CodaFi_](https://twitter.com/CodaFi_)) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitching-the-start-of-variadic-generics/51467) about the start of variadic generics.

> As part of our efforts to improve the ergonomics of the generics system, as well as providing better support for abstractions that use tuples, I wanted to approach y’all with a sketch for the surface syntax and preliminary semantics. Because this is a large topic area with a lot of impacts on the direction of both the language and later proposals, your feedback is critical at this stage for shaping the direction this feature set is taken in.

> I want to thank (in no particular order) Alejandro Alonso, Doug Gregor, and Slava Pestov for shaping my thinking on this subject, and for advancing a lot of the foundations here.
