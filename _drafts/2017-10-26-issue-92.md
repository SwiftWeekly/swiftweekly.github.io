### News and community

Swift Core team [posted](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-1-release-process/) the article that the goals, release process, and estimated schedule for Swift 4.1. Swift 4.1 is a source compatible update to Swift 4.0, but is not binary compatible with 4.0. Swift 4.1 is intended to be released in the first half of 2018.

Andre Videla [posted](https://medium.com/@andre_videla/total-programming-in-swift-526508c12a74) discussion of how Swift encourages it's totality. And there's a [discussion](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/918885734890663937) on Twitter.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) [started](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/922357520819134465) interesting accompanied discussion to improvements of type checker performance in non-WMO builds of projects with many classes.

Harlan Haskins made a great [talk](academy.realm.io/posts/improving-swift-tools-with-libsyntax-try-swift-haskin-2017/) about structure of libSyntax, design decisions involved with it, and how to make use of it to analyze, generate, and transform Swift code.

It's never too much to repeat the basics, especially in Swift. Ennio Masi [wrote](https://medium.com/@EnnioMa/back-to-the-fundamentals-sorting-algorithms-in-swift-from-scratch-fccf8a3daea3) all popular sorting algorithms in pure SwiftðŸ¤“.

If you still doubted to use Swift - check [this](https://medium.com/@guydaher/what-stats-and-surveys-are-saying-about-swift-in-2017-7e21dcce1f8b) stats and surveys around Swift. Swift's position is stronger and strongerðŸ’ª.
