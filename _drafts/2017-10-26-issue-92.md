Greetings! Hope you're feeling a little rested from the week off and are ready to absorb Swift news again. There has been some interesting development activity at the main Swift repo over the past two weeks. Plus, two exciting themes have been covered by Swift Unwrapped. Enjoy the issue!

### Starter tasks

* [SR-6082](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6082): Produce a better error message if Swift is run on a system without clang++
* [SR-6102](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6102): Improve `Sequence.elementsEqual` and `lexicographicallyPrecedes`
* [SR-6154](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6154): Add support for `LLVM_REVERSE_ITERATION` and use it to uncover non-determinism
* [SR-6207](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6207): Misleading error for unqualified use of static variable in method

### Swift Unwrapped

[Episode 33: HTTP server v0.1.0](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/89166): Jesse and JP discuss the first release of the HTTP server library from the Swift Server APIs project.

[Episode 34: Floating-Point](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/91615): JP and Jesse share their thoughts on numeric protocols and types, especially those of the floating point variety.

### News and community

Swift Core team [posted](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-1-release-process/) an article discussing the goals, release process, and estimated schedule for Swift 4.1. Swift 4.1 is a source compatible update to Swift 4.0, but is not binary compatible with 4.0. Swift 4.1 is intended to be released in the first half of 2018.

Andre Videla [posted](https://medium.com/@andre_videla/total-programming-in-swift-526508c12a74) a discussion of how Swift encourages it's totality. And there's a [discussion](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/918885734890663937) on Twitter.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) [started](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/922357520819134465) an interesting discussion on improvements to type checker performance in non-WMO builds of projects with many classes.

Harlan Haskins gave a great [talk](academy.realm.io/posts/improving-swift-tools-with-libsyntax-try-swift-haskin-2017/) about the structure of libSyntax, design decisions behind it, and how to make use of it to analyze, generate, and transform Swift code.

It's never too much to repeat the basics, especially in Swift. Ennio Masi [wrote](https://medium.com/@EnnioMa/back-to-the-fundamentals-sorting-algorithms-in-swift-from-scratch-fccf8a3daea3) about popular sorting algorithms in pure SwiftðŸ¤“.

If you're still doubting to use Swift - check [these](https://medium.com/@guydaher/what-stats-and-surveys-are-saying-about-swift-in-2017-7e21dcce1f8b) stats and surveys. Swift's position is stronger and stronger ðŸ’ª.

The [implementation](github.com/apple/swift/pull/9619) of [SE-0185: Synthesizing Equatable and Hashable conformance](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0185-synthesize-equatable-hashable.md) [might go out](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9619#issuecomment-336746025) in "Swift 4.1" in early 2018 ðŸŽ‰.

### Commits and pull requests

[Greg Titus](https://github.com/gregomni) and [Slava Pestov](https://github.com/slavapestov) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12440) a crash when a statement in an `if let` referenced a binding defined later, for example `if let b = c, c = ...`.

[Greg Spiers](https://github.com/gspiers) [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11744) a draft Swift Evolution [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/707) "Remove ownership keyword support in protocols" to remove support for `weak` and `unowned` keywords for property declarations in protocols.

[Kacper Harasim](https://github.com/Kacper20) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12281) [SR-6051: Refactoring to expand missing switch cases from `switch` keyword](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6051) to provide cursor refactoring, when the cursor is anywhere on `switch` keyword lets a user to expand missing switch cases into code placeholders.

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://github.com/xedin) [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12482) improvements to mangling: improve handling of the variadic function parameters.

[Rintaro Ishizaki](https://github.com/rintaro) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12457) pull request to fix [SR-5869: trailing closure not parsed correctly in if-statement conditional](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5869). The deal is: this fix allows users to write conditional statements with functions with trailing closures inside without parentheses. Before `if nums.filter ({ $0 % 2 == 0 }).isEmpty {`; after `if nums.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }.isEmpty {`.

[Doug Gregor](https://github.com/DougGregor) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12633) compiler crash [SR-6100: Compilation hangs when catching error with associated value defined inside generic class/struct](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6100).

[Mark Lacey](https://github.com/rudkx) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12631) pull request with implementation of warning in case of type is spelled as `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional` rather than `T`!. It seems [SE-0054: Abolish ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional type](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0054-abolish-iuo.md) will get a full implementation soon!

[Robert Widmann](https://github.com/CodaFi) [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/114) [implementation](https://github.com/apple/swift/compare/master...CodaFi:ace-attorney) of pre-proposal [CaseEnumerable protocol (derived	collection of enum cases)](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160111/006876.html).

[Huon Wilson](https://github.com/huonw) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12430) pull request that improves Swift Intermediate Language. Conditional conformances are inching closer and closer.

[Tony Allevato](https://github.com/allevato) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12598) pull request with improvements into synthesize of Equatable/Hashable: synthesis for fields/associated values that are tuples where all fields are Equatable/Hashable.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12595) various regressions against the master branch.

### Proposals

No updates on proposals this week. As always, you can check out the [Swift Evolution status page](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) for all the details.

### Mailing lists

Xiaodi Wu [pitched a draft proposal](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171009/040362.html) at [swift-dev] to rename Sequence.elementsEqual.

> The current behavior of Sequence.elementsEqual is potentially confusing to
> users given its name. Having surveyed the alternative solutions to this
> problem, it is proposed that the method be renamed to
> Sequence.lexicographicallyEquals.

Xiaodi Wu [continued](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20171016/005629.html) the conversation about rationalizing FloatingPoint conformance to Equatable at [swift-dev].

> Regardless of whether or not
> it is wise for the partial equivalence relation `FloatingPoint.==` to be
> deemed as semantically satisfactory for the purposes of `Equatable`, the
> fact remains that Swift deliberately ships with such a conformance, and
> `Array.==` should not blow up given that explicitly contemplated design
> decision. This PR resolves that proximal issue.

Max Moiseev [started a discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171023/040609.html) with introduction of new standard sequence method: Sequence.filteredMap(_:). Here's the [proposal draft](https://gist.github.com/moiseev/2f36376c8ef4c2b1273cff0bfd9c3b95).

Slava Pestov [came with pitch](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20171023/040641.html) to deprecate AnyObject method dispatch.

> Dynamic dispatch of methods through AnyObject is a source of implementation complexity, has many known bugs which we are not going to fix
