### Swift Unwrapped

[Episode 33: HTTP server v0.1.0](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/89166): Jesse and JP discuss the first release of the HTTP server library from the Swift Server APIs project.

[Episode 34: Floating-Point](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/91615): JP and Jesse share their thoughts on numeric protocols and types, especially those of the floating point variety.

### News and community

Swift Core team [posted](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-1-release-process/) the article that the goals, release process, and estimated schedule for Swift 4.1. Swift 4.1 is a source compatible update to Swift 4.0, but is not binary compatible with 4.0. Swift 4.1 is intended to be released in the first half of 2018.

Andre Videla [posted](https://medium.com/@andre_videla/total-programming-in-swift-526508c12a74) discussion of how Swift encourages it's totality. And there's a [discussion](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/918885734890663937) on Twitter.

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) [started](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/922357520819134465) interesting accompanied discussion to improvements of type checker performance in non-WMO builds of projects with many classes.

Harlan Haskins made a great [talk](academy.realm.io/posts/improving-swift-tools-with-libsyntax-try-swift-haskin-2017/) about structure of libSyntax, design decisions involved with it, and how to make use of it to analyze, generate, and transform Swift code.

It's never too much to repeat the basics, especially in Swift. Ennio Masi [wrote](https://medium.com/@EnnioMa/back-to-the-fundamentals-sorting-algorithms-in-swift-from-scratch-fccf8a3daea3) all popular sorting algorithms in pure SwiftðŸ¤“.

If you still doubted to use Swift - check [this](https://medium.com/@guydaher/what-stats-and-surveys-are-saying-about-swift-in-2017-7e21dcce1f8b) stats and surveys around Swift. Swift's position is stronger and strongerðŸ’ª.

### Commits and pull requests

[Greg Titus](https://github.com/gregomni) and [Slava Pestov](https://github.com/slavapestov) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12440) a crash when a statement in an 'if let' referenced a binding defined later, for example **if let b = c, c = ...**.

[Greg Spiers](https://github.com/gspiers) [made](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/11744) an implementation of a draft Swift Evolution [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/707) "Remove ownership keyword support in protocols" to remove support for 'weak' and 'unowned' keywords for property declarations in protocols.

[Kacper Harasim](https://github.com/Kacper20) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12281) [SR-6051: Refactoring to expand missing switch cases from `switch` keyword](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6051) to provide cursor refactoring, when the cursor is anywhere on `switch` keyword lets a user to expand missing switch cases into code placeholders.

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://github.com/xedin) [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12482) improvements to mangling: improve handling of the variadic function parameters.

[Rintaro Ishizaki](https://github.com/rintaro) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12457) merge request to fix [SR-5869: trailing closure not parsed correctly in if-statement conditional](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5869). The deal is: this fix allows users to write conditional statements with functions with trailing closures inside without parentheses. Before **if nums.filter ({ $0 % 2 == 0 }).isEmpty {**; after **if nums.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }.isEmpty {**.

[Doug Gregor](https://github.com/DougGregor) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12633) compiler crash [SR-6100: Compilation hangs when catching error with associated value defined inside generic class/struct](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6100).

[Mark Lacey](https://github.com/rudkx) [opened](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12631) merge request with implementation of warning in case of type is spelled as ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional rather than T!.

https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12631 SE-0054 is another proposal thatâ€™s getting a full implementation soon
