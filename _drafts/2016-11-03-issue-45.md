### News and community

Ole Begemann wrote an article, [*How to Read the Swift Standard Library Source*](https://oleb.net/blog/2016/10/swift-stdlib-source/), where he explains how to checkout and build Swift, and gives tips for digging into the source. This is a great way to get started with Swift, especially if you've been confused by `.gyb` files.

Brian Gesiak wrote a post on [swift-llvm and swift-clang](http://modocache.io/swift-llvm-and-swift-clang), explaining why Apple released custom forks of LLVM and clang, and what they contain that the upstream repositories do not.

Brian Gesiak got [Swift building on CentOS](https://twitter.com/modocache/status/792592110532853761).
