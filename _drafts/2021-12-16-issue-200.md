### Podcasts

In [episode 110](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/110/) of the Swift by Sundell podcast, [Tim Condon](https://twitter.com/0xTim), joins [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) to discuss how both client and server-side Swift developers could utilize the new built-in concurrency system, as well as how distributed actors and other upcoming language features might continue to make Swift even more capable on the server.

### News and community

Amazon Web Services [announed](https://twitter.com/awsdevelopers/status/1466476358389874704) that [AWS SDK for the Swift programming language](https://t.co/0x27sFTE3p) is now available in developer preview.

[Vincent Pradeilles](https://twitter.com/v_pradeilles) posted [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii1mDtDr3xo) check out Swift's standard library.

### Commits and pull requests

[Alejandro Alonso](https://github.com/Azoy) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/40340) that drops ICU.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0331](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0331-remove-sendable-from-unsafepointer.md) *Remove Sendable conformance from unsafe pointer types* was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0331-remove-sendable-conformance-from-unsafe-pointer-types/53979).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0335](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0335-existential-any.md): *Introduce existential `any`* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0335-introduce-existential-any/53934).

> Existential types in Swift have an extremely lightweight spelling: a plain protocol name in type context means an existential type. Over the years, this has risen to the level of **active harm** by causing confusion, leading programmers down the wrong path that often requires them to re-write code once they hit a fundamental [limitation of value-level abstraction](https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-ui-of-generics/22814#heading--limits-of-existentials). This proposal makes the impact of existential types explicit in the language by annotating such types with `any`.

[SE-0336](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0336-distributed-actor-isolation.md): *Distributed actor isolation* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0336-distributed-actor-isolation/53939).

> With the recent introduction of [actors](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0306-actors.md) to the language, Swift gained powerful and foundational building blocks for expressing _thread-safe_ concurrent programs. This proposal is the first in a series of proposals aiming to extend Swift's actor runtime with the concept of _distributed actors_, allowing developers leverage the actor model not only in local, but also distributed settings.
>
> With distributed actors, we acknowledge that the world we live in is increasingly built around distributed systems, and that we should provide developers with better tools to work within those environments. We aim to simplify and push the state-of-the-art for distributed systems programming in Swift as we did with concurrent programming with local actors and Swift’s structured concurrency approach embedded in the language.
>
> This proposal focuses on the extended actor isolation and type-checking aspects of distributed actors.

[SSWG-0018](https://github.com/swift-server/sswg/blob/main/proposals/0018-mqtt-nio.md): *MQTTNIO Proposal* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/sswg-0018-mqttnio-proposal/54004).

> There are a number of Swift MQTT libraries out there but many are not built on top of SwiftNIO. And many only support one version of the protocol or don’t provide WebSocket or TLS connections. MQTTNIO provides all of these. The library has also recently gained new Swift concurrency APIs.

### Swift Forums

[Evan Wilde](https://forums.swift.org/u/etcwilde) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-unavailability-from-asynchronous-contexts/53877) the `@unavailableFromAsync` attribute.

> The Swift concurrency model allows tasks to suspend and resume on different threads. While this behaviour allows higher utility of computational resources, there are some nasty pitfalls that can spring on an unsuspecting programmer. One such pitfall is the undefined behaviour from unlocking a `pthread_mutex_t` from a different thread than the thread that holds the lock. Reading from and writing to thread-local storage across suspension points can also result in unintended behavior, since the operation may be resuming on a different thread.

[Tom Doron](https://twitter.com/tomerdoron) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-package-manager-statically-link-swift-runtime-libraries-by-default-on-supported-platforms/53900) to statically link Swift runtime libraries by default on supported platforms.

> Swift 5.3.1 introduced [statically linking the Swift runtime libraries on Linux](https://forums.swift.org/t/static-linking-on-linux-in-swift-5-3-1/). With this feature, users can set the `--static-swift-stdlib` flag when invoking  SwiftPM commands (or the long form `-Xswiftc -static-stdlib`) in order to statically link the Swift runtime libraries into the program.
>
> On some platforms, such as Linux, this is often the preferred way to link programs, since the program is easier to deploy to the target server or otherwise share.
>
> This proposal explores making it SwiftPM's default behavior when building executable programs on such platforms.

[Frederick Kellison-Linn](https://forums.swift.org/u/jumhyn) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/swift-6-reconsider-escaping-for-optional-function-type-parameters/53932) to reconsider `@escaping` for optional function-type parameters.

[Kavon Farvardin]() updated [the proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-2-on-actors-and-initialization/53972) on Actors and Initialization.

> Since the proposal differs significantly from the first review, this is a pitch. Here's a very informal and incomplete summary of the major functionality proposed, along with some links into the document itself for more details:

> 1.  Actor initializers that are not isolated to the actor will now allow you to do anything you normally can from a `nonisolated` method. In exchange, Swift will automatically reject accesses to stored properties that might be unsafe. Here is the [problem description 2](https://github.com/kavon/swift-evolution/blob/actor-initializers-review2/proposals/0327-actor-initializers.md#overly-restrictive-non-async-initializers) and [proposed solution 1](https://github.com/kavon/swift-evolution/blob/actor-initializers-review2/proposals/0327-actor-initializers.md#initializers-with-nonisolated-self).
> 2.  Deinitializers of an actor can no longer access non-sendable stored properties of the instance. Here is the [problem description 1](https://github.com/kavon/swift-evolution/blob/actor-initializers-review2/proposals/0327-actor-initializers.md#data-races-in-deinitializers) and [proposed solution](https://github.com/kavon/swift-evolution/blob/actor-initializers-review2/proposals/0327-actor-initializers.md#deinitializers)
> 3.  A type's stored property cannot have a default value if its isolation is not compatible with its initializers. Here is the [problem description](https://github.com/kavon/swift-evolution/blob/actor-initializers-review2/proposals/0327-actor-initializers.md#stored-property-isolation) and [proposed solution](https://github.com/kavon/swift-evolution/blob/actor-initializers-review2/proposals/0327-actor-initializers.md#global-actor-isolation-and-instance-members)
> 4.  The `convenience` keyword is no longer required to define a delegating initializer of an actor. Here is the [problem description 3](https://github.com/kavon/swift-evolution/blob/actor-initializers-review2/proposals/0327-actor-initializers.md#initializer-delegation) and [proposed rules 2](https://github.com/kavon/swift-evolution/blob/actor-initializers-review2/proposals/0327-actor-initializers.md#delegating-initializers) for their delegating initializers, which is continued in the Sendability section.
