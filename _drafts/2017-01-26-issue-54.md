### Proposals in review

Chris Eidhofâ€™s proposal, [SE-0148](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0148-generic-subscripts.md): *Generic Subscripts*, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-January/000306.html).

> Currently, subscripts can't be generic. This is limiting in a number of ways:
>
> * Some subscripts are very specific and could be made more generic.
> * Some generic methods would feel more natural as a subscript, but currently can't be. This also makes it impossible to use them as lvalues.
This feature is also mentioned in the generics manifesto under [generic subscripts](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md#generic-subscripts).

> Example of a generic subscript:

{% highlight swift %}
extension Collection {
  subscript<Indices: Sequence>(indices: Indices) -> [Iterator.Element] where Indices.Iterator.Element == Index {
    // ...
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Or a generic return type:

{% highlight swift %}
extension JSON {
  subscript<T: JSONConvertible>(key: String) -> T? {
    // ...
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
