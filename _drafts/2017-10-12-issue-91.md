### News and community

Kubra Mracek improved the display of fatal errors and wrote a blog post [on Swift.org](https://swift.org/blog/xcode-9-1-improves-display-of-fatal-errors/) describing the changes. Now, you will see where and why a failure occurred, which is a big improvement to the previous ambiguous errors the main function.

### Commits and pull requests

Javi Soto [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12295) to make `+new` unavailable when `-init` is too.

Doug Gregor made [some more improvements](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12321) for type checking in the standard library. [Another 16% speedup](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/916452691840241664)!

David Ungar [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12335) to speed up compilation for full rebuilds in non-WMO (Whole Module Optimization) mode. And there's [more to come](https://twitter.com/senderPath/status/917270872209055744)!

Chris Lattner [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/12338) with some small improvements to the optimizer.

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0184](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0184-unsafe-pointers-add-missing.md): *Unsafe[Mutable][Raw][Buffer]Pointer: add missing methods, adjust existing labels for clarity, and remove deallocation size* was [accepted with revisions](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-October/000405.html).

> It was a large proposal for which most parts received a lot of support, while other parts were contentious. The proposal is accepted with revisions:
>
> - Partial initialization/assignment will be removed from this proposal and discussed separately
> - Some argument labels will be changed for clarity (`bytes` -> `byteCount`, `alignedTo` -> `alignment`)
> - The `count` argument to `deallocate()` will be removed entirely
