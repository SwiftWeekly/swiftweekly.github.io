    body: Hello, it's Paul Hudson from Hacking with Swift again, and after four weeks you're probably sick of seeing me here. So, I'll cut to the chase and get out of your way &mdash; I wrote a book about Server-Side Swift, and I think you'd like it.

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r) [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/1024) [SE-0158](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0158-package-manager-manifest-api-redesign.md), redesigning the Swift Package Manager API. The API now adheres to the Swift 3 guidelines! ðŸŽ‰

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0158](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0158-package-manager-manifest-api-redesign.md): *Package Manager Manifest API Redesign* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-March/000330.html) for Swift 4.

> The review of SE-0158 "Package Manager Manifest API Redesign" ran from March 7 until March 15. The proposal is accepted with the following revisions:
>
> â€“ The `To` in `upToNextMajor` and `upToNextMinor` will be capitalized.
>
> â€“ `upToNextMajor()` and `upToNextMinor()` will name the first parameter `from:` for clarity.
>
> â€“ `.only` will be removed, as it was duplicative versus `.exact`.
>
> â€“ We will have cases for `.branch` and `.revision` version specifiers, but will not provide special package initializers with named parameters for these.
>
> This proposal was generally supported, though it did require some discussion and minor revision, and some users are eager for future proposals adding new API not covered by this proposal.

[SE-0156](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0156-subclass-existentials.md): *Class and Subtype existentials* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-March/000331.html).

> The review of SE-0156 "Class and Subtype Existentials" ran from February 28...March 7, 2017. The proposal was very well-received and is accepted with one modification: the ordering rules for existential types that involve `AnyObject` or a `class` type will be removed.
>
> The ordering rules were intended to improve code clarity by requiring that the `class` (or `AnyObject`) constraint come first - `AnyObject & P` would be well-formed but `P & AnyObject` would be an errorâ€”enforcing more uniformity for Swift code and echoing a similar restriction that already exists for class definitions, where the superclass must come first. However, the ability to compose typealiases complicated the ordering rules considerably, and - [as noted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170227/033365.html) by Matthew Johnson - donâ€™t provide the guarantee that the class constraint will always be first. Therefore, the core team felt that the resulting ordering rules introduced more complexity than they provided clarity, and therefore do not belong in the language.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0159](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0159-fix-private-access-levels.md): *Fix Private Access Levels* by David Hart is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-March/000332.html).

> This proposal presents the problems that came with the the access level modifications in [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md) and proposes reverting to Swift 2 behaviour.
>
> Since the release of Swift 3, the access level change of [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md) was met with dissatisfaction by a substantial proportion of the general Swift community. Those changes can be viewed as *actively harmful*, the new requirement for syntax/API changes.
>
> [..]
>
> The `private` keyword should be reverted back to its Swift 2 file-based meaning and the `fileprivate` keyword should be deprecated.
