    heading: Server-Side Swift
    body: Hello, it's Paul Hudson from Hacking with Swift again, and after four weeks you're probably sick of seeing me here. So, I'll cut to the chase and get out of your way &mdash; I wrote a book about Server-Side Swift, and I think you'd like it.

This week `swift-stdlib-tool` was open-sourced, a number of proposals were accepted, Swift releases have themes, and a new proposal for fixing access controls in Swift is now under review!

### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 3: [Source Stability (What is a Source Breaking Change?)](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/61851)

Every Swift developer who has migrated code bases from Swift 1.x to 2.x, or even the more tedious 2.x to 3.x knows the pain of migrating to new Swift versions. In this episode we cover the intricacies of source stability and source-breaking changes. What exactly is a source-breaking change? It's not as straight-forward as you may think!

### News and community

[LLVM 4.0.0](http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2017-March/111025.html) was [released](http://releases.llvm.org/4.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html) this week. Congrats to those involved!

Ole Begemann wrote a post, [Swift Releases Have Themes](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/03/swift-themed-releases/), about a thoughtful message from Swift Core Team member Ben Cohen. Ole thinks Ben's message on swift-evolution deserves more attention, and I agree! It is a couple of weeks old, so sorry for missing this in last week's issue! 😳 Ole quotes the entire message and provides some commentary. Definitely read this.

### Commits and pull requests

In the [last](/issue-61/) [couple](/issue-60/) of issues, we discussed the removal and resurrection of `swift-stdlib-tool`. This week, Ted Kremenek [made the tool open source](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/8258)!

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r) [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/1024) [SE-0158](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0158-package-manager-manifest-api-redesign.md), redesigning the Swift Package Manager API. The API now adheres to the Swift 3 guidelines! 🎉

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0156](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0156-subclass-existentials.md): *Class and Subtype existentials* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-March/000331.html).

> The proposal was very well-received and is accepted with one modification: the ordering rules for existential types that involve `AnyObject` or a `class` type will be removed.
>
> The ordering rules were intended to improve code clarity by requiring that the `class` (or `AnyObject`) constraint come first - `AnyObject & P` would be well-formed but `P & AnyObject` would be an error—enforcing more uniformity for Swift code and echoing a similar restriction that already exists for class definitions, where the superclass must come first. However, the ability to compose typealiases complicated the ordering rules considerably, and - [as noted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170227/033365.html) by Matthew Johnson - don’t provide the guarantee that the class constraint will always be first. Therefore, the core team felt that the resulting ordering rules introduced more complexity than they provided clarity, and therefore do not belong in the language.

[SE-0157](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0157-recursive-protocol-constraints.md): *Support recursive constraints on associated types* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170320/034266.html).

> The feedback on the proposal was unfailingly positive. Accordingly, the proposal has been accepted without further modification.

[SE-0158](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0158-package-manager-manifest-api-redesign.md): *Package Manager Manifest API Redesign* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-March/000330.html) for Swift 4.

> The proposal is accepted with the following revisions:
>
> * The `To` in `upToNextMajor` and `upToNextMinor` will be capitalized.
> * `upToNextMajor()` and `upToNextMinor()` will name the first parameter `from:` for clarity.
> * `.only` will be removed, as it was duplicative versus `.exact`.
> * We will have cases for `.branch` and `.revision` version specifiers, but will not provide special package initializers with named parameters for these.
>
> This proposal was generally supported, though it did require some discussion and minor revision, and some users are eager for future proposals adding new API not covered by this proposal.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0159](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0159-fix-private-access-levels.md): *Fix Private Access Levels* by David Hart is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-March/000332.html).

> This proposal presents the problems that came with the the access level modifications in [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md) and proposes reverting to Swift 2 behaviour.
>
> Since the release of Swift 3, the access level change of [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md) was met with dissatisfaction by a substantial proportion of the general Swift community. Those changes can be viewed as *actively harmful*, the new requirement for syntax/API changes.
>
> The `private` keyword is a "soft default" access modifier for restricting access within a file. Scoped access is not a good behavior for a "soft default" because it is extremely common to use several extensions within a file. A "soft default" (and therefore `private`) should work well with this idiom. It is fair to say that changing the behavior of `private` such that it does not work well with extensions meets the criteria of actively harmful in the sense that it subtly encourages overuse of scoped access control and discourages the more reasonable default by giving it the awkward name `fileprivate`.
>
> [...]
>
> The `private` keyword should be reverted back to its Swift 2 file-based meaning and the `fileprivate` keyword should be deprecated.
