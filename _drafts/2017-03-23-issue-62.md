    body: Hello, it's Paul Hudson from Hacking with Swift again, and after four weeks you're probably sick of seeing me here. So, I'll cut to the chase and get out of your way &mdash; I wrote a book about Server-Side Swift, and I think you'd like it.

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r) [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/1024) [SE-0158](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0158-package-manager-manifest-api-redesign.md), redesigning the Swift Package Manager API. The API now adheres to the Swift 3 guidelines! 🎉

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0158](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0158-package-manager-manifest-api-redesign.md): *Package Manager Manifest API Redesign* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-March/000330.html) for Swift 4.

> The review of SE-0158 "Package Manager Manifest API Redesign" ran from March 7 until March 15. The proposal is accepted with the following revisions:
>
> – The `To` in `upToNextMajor` and `upToNextMinor` will be capitalized.
>
> – `upToNextMajor()` and `upToNextMinor()` will name the first parameter `from:` for clarity.
>
> – `.only` will be removed, as it was duplicative versus `.exact`.
>
> – We will have cases for `.branch` and `.revision` version specifiers, but will not provide special package initializers with named parameters for these.
>
> This proposal was generally supported, though it did require some discussion and minor revision, and some users are eager for future proposals adding new API not covered by this proposal.
