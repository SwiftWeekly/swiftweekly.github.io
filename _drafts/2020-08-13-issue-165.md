Summer is already in the second half and seems that the Swift community has gained some steam before the official Xcode releases.

Additional to that Swift on the server folks have great news about AWS Lambda and Kiture now is a community project!

I think this is only calm before the (autumn) storm. We will have more awesome news in the coming weeks.

### Proposals in review

[SSWG-0015](https://github.com/swift-server/sswg/blob/master/proposals/0015-swift-service-lifecycle.md): *Swift Service Lifecycle* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/sswg-0015-swift-service-lifecycle/39157).

> Most services have startup and shutdown workflow-logic which is often sensitive to failure and hard to get right. Startup sequences include actions like initializing thread pools, running data migrations, warming up caches, and other forms of state initialization before taking traffic or accepting events. Shutdown sequences include freeing up resources that hold on to file descriptors or other system resources that may leak if not cleared correctly.
> 
> Today, server applications and frameworks must find ways to address the need on their own, which could be error prone. To make things safer and easier, Service Lifecycle codifies this common need in a safe, reusable and framework-agnostic way. It is designed to be integrated with any server framework or directly in a server application’s main.
