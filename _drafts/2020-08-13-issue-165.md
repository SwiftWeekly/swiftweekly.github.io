Summer is already in its second half and seems that the Swift community has gained some steam before the official Xcode releases.

Additionally, the people working on Swift on the server have great news about AWS Lambda and Kitura is now a community project!

I think this is a calm before the (autumn) storm. We will have more awesome news in the coming weeks.

### Proposals in review

[SSWG-0015](https://github.com/swift-server/sswg/blob/master/proposals/0015-swift-service-lifecycle.md): *Swift Service Lifecycle* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/sswg-0015-swift-service-lifecycle/39157).

> Most services have startup and shutdown workflow-logic which is often sensitive to failure and hard to get right. Startup sequences include actions like initializing thread pools, running data migrations, warming up caches, and other forms of state initialization before taking traffic or accepting events. Shutdown sequences include freeing up resources that hold on to file descriptors or other system resources that may leak if not cleared correctly.
> 
> Today, server applications and frameworks must find ways to address the need on their own, which could be error prone. To make things safer and easier, Service Lifecycle codifies this common need in a safe, reusable and framework-agnostic way. It is designed to be integrated with any server framework or directly in a server application’s main.

### Swift Forums

[Matthew Cheok](https://twitter.com/matthewcheok) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/organizing-stored-properties-in-extensions/38902) on stored properties in extensions.

> A very common pattern for organizing methods is using extensions within the module a type is declared in, in order to group methods semantically or for some other reason. These methods behave as if they are declared within the initial declaration itself and UIKit also uses this system of organization in its (generated) Swift interfaces. However, we can't do this today with properties because all stored properties need to be declared within the initial declaration.

[Richard Clements](https://forums.swift.org/u/richard-clements) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/deferred-property-wrappers/38931) about deferred property wrappers.

> I wanted to make a pitch for a deferred style of property wrapper, that will work with lazy properties only. The purpose is that you would be able to use another (non lazy) property as a dependency for the property wrapper.

[Elvis Shi](https://forums.swift.org/u/lovee) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/sort-by-min-by-max-by-with-keypaths/38976) to add `sort(by:)` , `min(by:)` and `max(by:)` with keyPaths.

> [..] now we've got the new KeyPath feature, but we still don't have a convenient method to sort a sequence, or get the max / min element by its elements' properties

[Todd Varland](https://forums.swift.org/u/varland) shared the Swift Server Work Group [July 8th, 2020](https://forums.swift.org/t/july-8th-2020/39092) meeting notes, and [Peter Adams](https://forums.swift.org/u/peteradams-a) shared the [July 29th, 2020](https://forums.swift.org/t/july-29th-2020/39107) meeting notes.

[Karoy Lorentey](https://twitter.com/lorentey) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/ironing-out-managedbuffer-api-wrinkles/39072) on how to iron out the `ManagedBuffer` API wrinkles.

> As uncovered in [PR #31686](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/31686), the API of `ManagedBuffer` (and it's less-liked sibling `ManagedBufferPointer`) implicitly assume that it's possible to easily retrieve the size of a dynamically allocated chunk of memory. Platforms often allow this through functions like `malloc_size`, `malloc_usable_size` or `_msize` — but it turns out not all of them do. In particular, OpenBSD evidently doesn't support this.
>
> This makes these stdlib APIs suboptimal — on OpenBSD, the implementation would need to bend over backwards store the allocated capacity within the class instance, even though it is practically always duplicated in `Header`. The extra storage would waste memory and complicate element access in every `ManagedBuffer` instance, even in the (hopefully) vast majority of cases where `ManagedBuffer.capacity` is never called outside of the closure passed to the `create` method.
>
> I believe the stdlib's APIs shouldn't be needlessly difficult to implement on particular platforms. `ManagedBuffer`'s implicit requirement for a working `malloc_size` seems unreasonable.
>
> This seems like as good an excuse as any to start discussing a revision of these APIs.

[Michael Verges](https://github.com/maustinstar) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-manager-executable-only-dependencies/39070) that executable-only dependencies would allow packages to be imported only for use in the package's development environment.

> CLI tools distributed through Swift Packages, such as linters or documentation generators, are currently imported as dependencies. Although these dependencies may only exist to use as an executable during development, the dependencies are shipped with the package. End-users of a package do not need to inherit development tools from the package.
>
> This can encourage package developers to use more developer tools without frustrating end-users with unused dependencies.

[Tanner Nelson](https://twitter.com/tanner0101) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/generic-connection-pool/39161) to implement a Generic Connection Pool.

> Connection pooling is a critical component for many server-side applications. I would attempt to summarize connection pooling here, but honestly [Wikipedia's page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool) does a better job:
>
>> In software engineering, a connection pool is a cache of database connections maintained so that the connections can be reused when future requests to the database are required. Connection pools are used to enhance the performance of executing commands on a database.
