### Swift Unwrapped

[50: Swift 4.1 w/ Doug & Ben (part 1)](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/125759): Jessie & JP go over the Swift 4.1 release highlights with Ben Cohen and Doug Gregor from the Swift team.

### Commits and pull requests

[Karoy Lorentey](https://github.com/lorentey) merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/14913) which made Swift use a much higher-quality hashing with random seeding. You can read about this change in the [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/psa-the-stdlib-now-uses-randomly-seeded-hash-values/10789).
[Karoy Lorentey](https://github.com/lorentey) merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/14913) which made Swift use a much higher-quality hashing with random seeding. You can read about this change in the [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/psa-the-stdlib-now-uses-randomly-seeded-hash-values/10789).

>“Random seeding” means that `hashValue` properties will return different values on each execution of a Swift program. This is an important tool for improving the reliability of the Standard Library’s hashing collections, `Set` and `Dictionary`. In particular, random seeding enables better protection against (accidental or deliberate) [hash-flooding attacks](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/12/huge-portions-of-web-vulnerable-to-hashing-denial-of-service-attack/).

[Joe Groff](https://github.com/jckarter) merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15145/) that made generic parameter counts in context descriptors 16-bit from 32-bit, reducing the metadata.

> The specific changes to the proposal as reviewed are:
> - `@objc` enums defined in Swift will receive automatic synthesis of the list of all cases.
> - Unavailable cases will not be listed, because values of an unavailable case cannot exist in a well-typed Swift program (in breaks the availability model).
> - Automatic synthesis is only provided when the conformance is stated on the `enum` definition (not an extension), following the precedent set by `Codable` ([SE-0167](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0167-swift-encoders.md)) and `Equatable`/`Hashable` synthesis ([SE-0185](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0185-synthesize-equatable-hashable.md)).
> - The protocol, associated type, and property are named `CaseIterable`, `AllCases`, and `allCases`, respectively. The core team felt that these names reflect the primary use case of this protocol, promoting better clarity for most code that iterates over all of the cases.  

### Accepted proposals

[SE-0194](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0194-derived-collection-of-enum-cases.md) *Derived Collection of Enum Cases*  was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0194-derived-collection-of-enum-cases/10723) with revisions.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0193](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0193-cross-module-inlining-and-specialization.md) *Cross-module inlining and specialization*
 is [under extended review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0193-cross-module-inlining-and-specialization/7310/59).
 
> This proposal will essentially be accepted as is — except for the name for `@abiPublic`. Many people voiced concern for this name. While it technically is accurate, it exposes the term “abi” which will be foreign to many. It also doesn’t connote the full implications and value of adding the attribute.
 
[SE-0192](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0192-non-exhaustive-enums.md) *Non-Exhaustive Enums* is in [re-review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0192-non-exhaustive-enums/7291).
 
>  The second review is follow up to the [original review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0192-non-exhaustive-enums/7291) based on feedback on the thread and from the Core Team.

### Swift Forums

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r) & [Daniel Dunbar](https://github.com/ddunbar) proposed [*Package Manager Extensible Build Tools*](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r/swift-evolution/blob/extensible-tool/proposals/NNNN-package-manager-extensible-tools.md). This will allow community build tools ([Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery), [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint), [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy), etcetera) to integrate with the Swift Package Manager. You can contribute & follow the discussion on the [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-manager-extensible-build-tools/10900).

> This is a proposal for adding package manager support for extensible build tools, i.e. executing tools at build time which were themselves produced by some other package, and whose behavior the package manager does not understood directly, but rather interacts through a well-defined, Swift, protocol.
>  
>  We expect this behavior to greatly enhance our capacity for building complex software packages.

[Graydon Hoare](https://github.com/graydon) wrote about a new compilation mode called “batch” or “multiple file” mode.

> This new mode takes the set of files that would normally be (incrementally) compiled with individual subprocesses, and assigns them dynamically to multiple batches (one per core), compiling each batch with a single process. This means that incremental mode is still operative, and compilation makes use of multiple cores, but the benefits of whole-module mode (fewer processes, less redundant work) also apply. 
  
If you’re feeling adventurous and want to give it a try, the instructions are present on the [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/compilation-speed-help-test-batch-mode/10964)
