### News and community



### Commits and pull requests

[Karoy Lorentey](https://github.com/lorentey) merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/14913) which made Swift use a much higher-quality hashing with a random seeding. You can read about this change in [swift forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/psa-the-stdlib-now-uses-randomly-seeded-hash-values/10789)

>“Random seeding” means that hashValue properties will return different values on each execution of a Swift program. This is an important tool for improving the reliability of the Standard Library’s hashing collections, `Set` and `Dictionary`. In particular, random seeding enables better protection against (accidental or deliberate) [hash-flooding attacks](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/12/huge-portions-of-web-vulnerable-to-hashing-denial-of-service-attack/).

[Joe Groff](https://github.com/jckarter) merge a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15145/) that made generic parameter counts in context descriptors 16-bit from 32-bit reducing the metadata. 64K generic parameters ought to be enough for anyone, right? 🧐 

### Accepted proposals

### Proposals in review

[SE-0193](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0193-cross-module-inlining-and-specialization.md) Review of *Cross-module inlining and specialization*
 [extended](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0193-cross-module-inlining-and-specialization/7310/59) to resolve naming of 'abiPublic' attribute.
 
> This proposal will essentially be accepted as is — except for the name for @abiPublic. Many people voiced concern for this name. While it technically is accurate, it exposes the term “abi” which will be foreign to many. It also doesn’t connote the full implications and value of adding the attribute.
 
[SE-0192](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0192-non-exhaustive-enums.md) *Non-Exhaustive Enums* is in [re-review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0192-non-exhaustive-enums/7291).
 
> The second review of the review of SE 0192 — Non-Exhaustive Enums begins now and runs through March 23, 2018.
>
>  The second review is follow up to the [original review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0192-non-exhaustive-enums/7291) based on feedback on the thread and from the Core Team.

### Swift Forums

[Ankit Aggarwal](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r) & [Daniel Dunbar](https://github.com/ddunbar) proposed [*Package Manager Extensible Build Tools*](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r/swift-evolution/blob/extensible-tool/proposals/NNNN-package-manager-extensible-tools.md). This proposal will allow community build tools ([Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery), [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint), [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy), etc) to integrate with the *Swift Package Manager*.


> This is a proposal for adding package manager support for extensible build tools, i.e. executing tools at build time which were themselves produced by some other package, and whose behavior the package manager does not understood directly, but rather interacts through a well-defined, Swift, protocol.
>  
>  We expect this behavior to greatly enhance our capacity for building complex software packages.

[Graydon Hoare](https://github.com/graydon) wrote about a new compilation mode called “batch” or “multiple file” mode.

> This new mode takes the set of files that would normally be (incrementally) compiled with individual subprocesses, and assigns them dynamically to multiple batches (one per core), compiling each batch with a single process. This means that incremental mode is still operative, and compilation makes use of multiple cores, but the benefits of whole-module mode (fewer processes, less redundant work) also apply. 
  
If you’re feeling adventurous and want to give it a try, the instructions are present on [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/t/compilation-speed-help-test-batch-mode/10964)
