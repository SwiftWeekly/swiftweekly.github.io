It seems that the world has turned upside down because of the Covid-19 virus. Most of the countries have been shut down and there is a lot of unknown in the future.
Apple has announced that WWDC 2020 will be a remote event. We all are learning how to work remotely from our homes to cope with all the madness going on.

Meanwhile, Swift 5.2 has been officially released along alongside with Xcode 11.4.

In [episode 69](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/69/) of Swift by Sundell podcast [Holly Borla](https://twitter.com/hollyborla) and [Grace Kendall](https://twitter.com/gracekendall26), both software engineers at Apple, join [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) to go on a deep dive into the Swift Playgrounds app and Swift 5.2’s new diagnostics engine.

### News and community

Apple [announced](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/) WWDC 2020 will be a completely online experience this year.

Apple [released](https://swift.org/blog/swift-5-2-released/) Swift 5.2 and [announced](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_11_4_release_notes) Xcode 11.4.

[Nicole Jacque](https://github.com/najacque/) wrote a [blog post](https://swift.org/blog/5-3-release-process/) about Swift 5.3 release process.

[Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) wrote a great [article](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/212/whats-new-in-swift-5-2) explaining what's new in Swift 5.2.

[Federico Zanetello](https://twitter.com/zntfdr) wrote two great articles about [ArgumentParser](https://www.fivestars.blog/code/a-look-into-argument-parser.html) and [Swift Executables Progress State](https://www.fivestars.blog/code/executables-progress.html).
He did not stop there are created a [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/zntfdr/whats-new-in-swift-5-dot-2) about new features in Swift 5.2.

Great [talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gI6Zk2jS0-MNkckYBnRFNtVCHoGKHWct/view) about Swift for TensorFlow which should have been given at TF Dev Summit.

RayWenderlich folks wrote a great [tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/8016626-swiftnio-tutorial-practical-guide-for-asynchronous-problems) on how to start with SwiftNIO.

[Bruno Rocha](https://twitter.com/rockbruno_) [wrote](https://swiftrocks.com/useful-global-swift-functions.html) an article explaining to us about useful global swift functions.


### Commits and pull requests

[Slava Pestov](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov) opened [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/28698) that fixes unapplied references to protocol methods, which was one of the oldest and most highly duped bugs ever. Good news is that it has been merged.

[Pavel Yaskevich](https://github.com/xedin) closed [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30627) created by [Luciano Almeida](https://github.com/LucianoPAlmeida) that resolves [SR-12382](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-12382) and improves the diagnostic optional inout to generic pointer conversion mismatch.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30537) that fixes handling of `@autoclosure` in `init(wrappedValue:)`.

[Luciano Almeida](https://github.com/LucianoPAlmeida) merged [a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/30440) that fixes [SR-11540](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11540) by just disfavoring overloads to closures with anonymous var that are function types with more than one argument that matches arguments of no-arg function types.

### Swift Forums

[Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal) pitched a `Circular Buffer`.

> Introduce the `CircularBuffer` collection type conforming to the `RandomAccessCollection`,
`RangeReplaceableCollection` and `MutableCollection` protocols. With random element
access and support for constant back and front element insertion and deletion.
> 
> Swift currently does not have collection with both element random access
and constant O(1) elements back and front insertion and deletion. A good
usage examples for such collection are queue, deque, fixed length buffers.
Such abstractions cannot effectively be build on Array because of O(n) first element deletion.

[Aamir Nazir](https://forums.swift.org/u/aamir-nazir) opened discussion about counting occurrences of a substring in a string.

> Given the fact that Swift String class doesn't has any method for counting occurrences of a substring in a string. i.e
> Counting occurrences of `"Swift"` in `"Hello Swift Swift"` => 2
> 
> There are many alternatives available for counting occurrences of substring but I think it would be more intuitive if we add support of counting occurrences of a substring in a string.

[Nate Cook](https://twitter.com/nnnnnnnn) [pitched](https://forums.swift.org/t/main-type-based-program-execution/34624) idea about adding a new attribute that you can use to designate a type that provides the entry point for a Swift program.

> This is a generalization of the `@UIApplicationMain` and `@NSApplicationMain` attributes that have been in Swift from the beginning, making that specialized behavior available to any library or framework.
> 
> The Swift compiler will recognize a type annotated with the `@main` attribute as providing the entry point for a program. Types marked with `@main` have a single implicit requirement: declaring a static `main()` method.

[tomerd](https://forums.swift.org/u/tomerd) [shared](https://forums.swift.org/t/march-4th-2020/34617) Swift on the Server Workgroup March 4th, 2020 meeting notes.

[Karoy Lorentey](https://twitter.com/lorentey) [pitched](https://forums.swift.org/t/low-level-atomic-operations/34683) idea bout Low-Level Atomic Operations.

>Here is a pitch for adding a limited set of low-level atomic operations to the Standard Library, including native spellings for C++-style acquire-release memory orderings. Our goal is to enable intrepid library authors to start building synchronization constructs directly in Swift.
> 
> This means we must start talking about how these things will work in Swift -- in other words, we need to start working on a concurrency memory model. Given that Swift already interoperates with the C/C++ memory model, it seems like a good idea to use that as a starting point.

[Cal Stephens](https://forums.swift.org/u/cal) started a [discussion](https://forums.swift.org/t/codingkeypath-add-support-for-encoding-and-decoding-nested-objects-with-dot-notation/34710) about how to add a new CodingKeyPath type that allows consumers to key into nested objects using [dot notation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1416468-value).

>Today, encoding and decoding Codable objects using the compiler's synthesized implementation requires that your object graph has a one-to-one mapping to the object graph of the target payload. This decreases the control that authors have over their `Codable` models.
