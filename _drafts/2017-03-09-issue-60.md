### Swift Unwrapped

This week, JP Simard and I launched [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped).

### News and community

When it comes to supporting Swift, Google and Facebook appear to have something in common: their build tools rely on the existence of `swift-stdlib-tool`, an Apple utility built into Xcode, which copies the Swift runtime into an application bundle. For an in-depth look at `swift-stdlib-tool`, consider reading [this Technical Q&A](https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/swift_and_objc.html) by [@queersorceress](https://twitter.com/queersorceress) (and don't forget to click on the "Donate" button at the bottom of that page).

Dmitry Shevchenko ([@dmishe89](https://twitter.com/dmishe89)) [reported](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3957) that `swift-stdlib-tool` has been removed in Xcode 8.3b2, and [filed](https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5608273688395776) an Apple Radar. If you use [Bazel](https://bazel.build) or [Buck](https://buckbuild.com) to compile iOS apps, and you'd like those tools to support Swift, you could help by duplicating the Radar.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0158](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0158-package-manager-manifest-api-redesign.md): *Package Manager Manifest API Redesign* by Ankit Aggarwal is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-March/000329.html).

> This is a proposal for redesigning the `Package.swift` manifest APIs provided by Swift Package Manager.
This proposal only redesigns the existing public APIs and does not add any new functionality; any API to be added for new functionality will happen in separate proposals.
>
> The `Package.swift` manifest APIs were designed prior to the API Design Guidelines, and their design was not reviewed by the evolution process. Additionally, there are several small areas which can be cleaned up to make the overall API more "Swifty".
>
> We would like to redesign these APIs as necessary to provide clean, conventions-compliant APIs that we can rely on in the future. Because we anticipate that the user community for the Swift Package Manager will grow considerably in Swift 4, we would like to make these changes now, before more packages are created using the old API.
