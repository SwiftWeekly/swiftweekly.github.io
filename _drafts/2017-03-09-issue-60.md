### Swift Unwrapped

This week, JP Simard and I launched [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped).

### News and community

When it comes to supporting Swift, Google and Facebook appear to have something in common: their build tools rely on the existence of `swift-stdlib-tool`, an Apple utility built into Xcode, which copies the Swift runtime into an application bundle. For an in-depth look at `swift-stdlib-tool`, consider reading [this Technical Q&A](https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/swift_and_objc.html) by [@queersorceress](https://twitter.com/queersorceress) (and don't forget to click on the "Donate" button at the bottom of that page).

Dmitry Shevchenko ([@dmishe89](https://twitter.com/dmishe89)) [reported](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3957) that `swift-stdlib-tool` has been removed in Xcode 8.3b2, and [filed](https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5608273688395776) an Apple Radar. If you use [Bazel](https://bazel.build) or [Buck](https://buckbuild.com) to compile iOS apps, and you'd like those tools to support Swift, you could help by duplicating the Radar.
