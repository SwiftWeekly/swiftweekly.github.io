### Proposals in review

[SE-0300](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0300-continuation.md): *Continuations for interfacing async tasks with synchronous code* is [under a review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0300-continuations-for-interfacing-async-tasks-with-synchronous-code/43891).

> Asynchronous Swift code needs to be able to work with existing synchronous code that uses techniques such as completion callbacks and delegate methods to respond to events. Asynchronous tasks can suspend themselves on continuations which synchronous code can then capture and invoke to resume the task in response to an event.

[SE-0299](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0299-extend-generic-static-member-lookup.md): *Extending Static Member Lookup in Generic Contexts* is [under a review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0299-extending-static-member-lookup-in-generic-contexts/43958).

> Using static member declarations to provide semantic names for commonly used values which can then be accessed via leading dot syntax is an important tool in API design, reducing type repetition and improving call-site legibility. Currently, when a parameter is generic, there is no effective way to take advantage of this syntax. This proposal aims to relax restrictions on accessing static members on protocols to afford the same call-site legibility to generic APIs.

[SE-0295](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0295-codable-synthesis-for-enums-with-associated-values.md): *Codable synthesis for enums with associated values* is [under the second review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0295-codable-synthesis-for-enums-with-associated-values-second-review/44036).

> Codable was introduced in [SE-0166](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0166-swift-archival-serialization.md)
with support for synthesizing `Encodable` and `Decodable` conformance for
`class` and `struct` types, that only contain values that also conform
to the respective protocols.
>
> This proposal will extend the support for auto-synthesis of these conformances
to enums with associated values.

### Swift Forums

[Holly Borla](https://twitter.com/hollyborla) updated the [SE-0293](https://github.com/filip-sakel/swift-evolution/blob/NNNN-extend-property-wrappers-to-functions-and-closures-amended/proposals/0293-extend-property-wrappers-to-function-and-closure-parameters.md): *Extend Property Wrappers to Function and Closure Parameters* pitch.

> *  Passing a projected value using the `$` calling syntax is supported via `init(projectedValue:)`.
> *  The type of the unapplied function reference uses the wrapped-value type by default. Referencing the function using the projected-value type is supported by writing `$` in front of the argument label, or `$_` if there is no argument label.
> *  Closures with property-wrapper parameters have the same semantics as unapplied function references.
> *  Additional arguments in the wrapper attribute are supported, and these arguments have the same evaluation semantics as default function arguments.

[Yim Lee](https://github.com/yim-lee/) [purposed](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-collection-signing/43855) an idea to add _signed_ package collections.

> Since **Package Collections** ([SE-0291](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0291-package-collections.md)) can be created and published by anyone, issues related to authenticity and integrity may emerge.
>
> *  Publishers can establish authenticity and protect their collections from tampering.
> *  Users can choose and consume collections based on trust guarantees and therefore help prevent package collections from being used as an attack vector.

[Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) [informed](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-3-concurrentvalue-and-concurrent-closures/43947) about updates to `ConcurrentValue` and `@concurrent` closures pitch.

> After a long hiatus due to the holidays and other constraints, I was able to incorporate [a bunch of feedback](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-2-protocol-based-actor-isolation/42123/) (primarily from [Doug](https://forums.swift.org/t/preventing-data-races-in-the-swift-concurrency-model/43175)) into [the old ActorSendable proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BEO6QwzcYCUhaGyA-WRoM_phRa7O7mGPNIMdSV4StEE/edit) -- largely rewriting it in the process.

[Mishal Shah](https://twitter.com/mishaldshah/) [let folks know](https://forums.swift.org/t/updating-llvm-project-swift-main-branch/44019) that an update will be performed to the `swift/main` branch for `apple/llvm-project` repository.

[Cory Benfield](https://twitter.com/Lukasaoz) [announced](https://forums.swift.org/t/introducing-swift-http-structured-headers/44041) new project [Swift HTTP Structured Headers](https://github.com/apple/swift-http-structured-headers) - a brand-new package that enables the Swift HTTP ecosystem to take advantage of new work being done by the IETF HTTP Working Group.

> HTTP Structured Header fields are [a draft specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-19) being worked on by the IETF. They provide a set of data types and algorithms for handling HTTP header field values in a consistent way, allowing a single parser and serializer to handle a wide range of header field values. Working with HTTP header fields in the absence of Structured Header Fields often requires separate parsers and serialisers for each individual field, leading to a proliferation of parsers and serializers. Structured Header Fields address this head-on, defining a common base language for defining header fields going forward.

[Doug Gregor](https://twitter.com/dgregor79) updated about the revised [actor proposal](https://github.com/DougGregor/swift-evolution/blob/actors/proposals/nnnn-actors.md).

> *  Added a discussion of the tradeoffs with actor reentrancy, performance, and deadlocks, with various examples, and the addition of new attribute `@reentrant(never)` to disable reentrancy at the actor or function level.
> * Removed global actors; they will be part of a separate document.
> * Separated out the discussion of data races for reference types.
> * Allow asynchronous calls to synchronous actor methods from outside the actor.
> * Removed the `Actor` protocol; we'll tackle customizing actors and executors in a separate proposal.
> * Clarify the role and behavior of actor-independence.
> *Add a section to "Alternatives Considered" that discusses actor inheritance.
> * Replace "actor class" with "actor".

(Kavon Farvardin)[https://twitter.com/call1cc] shared [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-effectful-read-only-properties/44090) that allows some properties to have effects specifiers (`throws` and `async`) added to them.

> Nominal types such as classes, structs, and enums in Swift support [computed properties](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html), which are members of the type that invoke programmer-specified computations when getting or setting them; instead of being tied to storage like stored properties.  The recently accepted proposal [SE-0296](https://github.com/kavon/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0296-async-await.md) introduced asynchronous functions via `async`, in conjunction with `await`, but did not specify that computed properties can support effects like asynchrony.  Furthermore, to take full advantage of `async` properties, the ability to specify that a property `throws` is also important.  This document aims to partially fill in this gap by proposing a syntax and semantics for effectful read-only computed properties.

[Daniel Duan](https://forums.swift.org/u/duan) [pitched](https://forums.swift.org/t/idea-bytes-literal/44124) "bytes literals" idea.

> I think Swift should have "bytes literals", supported by the compiler, as well as the standard library. Both `'hello'` and `'\x68\x65\x6C\x6C\x6F'` would be valid bytes literals, representing the same value.
> 
> **What _is_ a byte literal?**
> They are similar to literals for strings/integers/bools. The standard library would provide similar treatment as for other literals. Specifically:
>
> * Byte - Signless 8-bit value, not an int but has bit-twiddling facilities
> * Bytes - Collection of bytes with continuous storage: random access, range replaceable, etc.
> * `ExpressibleByBytesLiteral`, `BytesLiteralType`

[Rintaro Ishizaki](https://forums.swift.org/u/rintaro) pitched [a feature](https://forums.swift.org/t/if-for-postfix-member-expressions/44159) that expands `#if` functionality to postfix member expressions. Aan update-version of this proposal will be kept [here](https://github.com/rintaro/swift-evolution/blob/proposal-postfix-ifconfig-expressions/proposals/NNNN-postfix-ifconfig-expressions.md) and implementation [here](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/35097).

> Swift has conditional compilation block `#if ... #endif` which allows code to be conditionally compiled depending on the value of one or more compilation conditions. Currently, unlike `#if` in C family languages, the body of each clause must surround complete statements. However, in some cases, especially in result builder contexts, demand for applying `#if` to partial expressions has emerged. This proposal expands `#if ... #endif` to be able to surround postfix member expressions.
