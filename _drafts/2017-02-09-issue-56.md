### News and community

Chris Eidhof wrote a great post, [Classes That Conform To Protocols](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/classes-and-protocols/), that explains how to use type-erasers as a workaround until [generalized existentials](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md#generalized-existentials) arrive in Swift.

Orta Therox wrote a [retrospective on using Swift at Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/02/05/Retrospective-Swift-at-Artsy/). It's an incredibly interesting post that actually ends up being more about the pros and cons of adopting [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) instead of converting to Swift. Most importantly, he highlights some major, systemic issues with Apple's developer tools and ecosystem &mdash; in particular the lack of openness (Radar) and lack of extensibility (Xcode).

The Swift Server APIs work group held their second security stream meeting, and [posted the meeting minutes](https://github.com/swift-server/work-group/pull/72).

### Commits and pull requests

Dave Abrahams ([@dabrahams](https://github.com/dabrahams)) opened an initial [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/6752) to rethink the existing Unicode implementation. This work is part of the [String Manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/StringManifesto.md).

Erik Eckstein ([@eeckstein](https://github.com/eeckstein)) [made changes](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7274) to link a new re-mangler and de-mangler into the swift runtime library.

Slava Pestov ([@slavapestov](https://github.com/slavapestov)) [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/7296) an issue ([SR-3840](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3840)) where a closure that reads and writes to a computed parameter picks up the static type and not the dynamic type.

There's a [new repo](https://github.com/swift-server/security) under the [swift-server](https://github.com/swift-server) GitHub organization for the development of cross-platform Security APIs. It's currently empty except for a README, which has all of the details.

### Accepted proposals

Proposal [SE-0149](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0149-package-manager-top-of-tree.md): *Package Manager Support for Top of Tree development* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000314.html).

> The review of SE-0149 "Package Manager Support for Top of Tree development" ran from January 24...31. Feedback was positive, and the proposal is accepted for Swift 4. Thanks to everyone who participated!

Proposal [SE-0150](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0150-package-manager-branch-support.md): *Package Manager Support for branches* was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000315.html).

### Proposals in review

Proposal [SE-0151](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0151-package-manager-swift-language-compatibility-version.md): *Generic Subscripts* by Chris Eidhof is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000316.html).

> This proposal adds support for the Swift compiler's new "language compatibility version" feature to the package manager.
>
> The Swift compiler now supports a "language compatibility version" flag which specifies the Swift major language version that the compiler should try to accept. We need support for an additional package manager manifest feature in order for this feature to be used by Swift packages.

Proposal [SE-0152](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0152-package-manager-tools-version.md): *Generic Subscripts* by Chris Eidhof is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-February/000317.html).

> This proposal introduces a "Swift tools version" which is declared for each Swift package. The tools version declares the minimum version of the Swift tools required to use the package, determines what version of the PackageDescription API should be used in the Package.swift manifest, and determines which Swift language compatibility version should be used to parse the Package.swift manifest.
>
> This feature shall be added to Swift 3.1, to allow packages to manage the transition from Swift 3 to Swift 4 compatibility.
