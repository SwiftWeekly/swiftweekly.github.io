> TK insert poem here

There’s been plenty of news to make developers experience the full range of emotions: [Xcode 9.3](https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/?id=03292018d) with [Swift 4.1](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-1-released/) made it out of the gate, the WWDC lottery smiled on some, and caused gnashing of teeth in others.

Meanwhile, Swift 4.2 and beyond await us. As a reminder, the final merge into the Swift 4.2 branch before a soak period is [coming up in two weeks, on April 20](https://swift.org/blog/4-2-release-process/).

What’s new in the world of Swift? Read on!

### Swift Unwrapped

[Episode 51](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/125760) is the long-awaited Part 2 of Doug Gregor and Ben Cohen discussing Swift 4.1.

In [Episode 52](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/129738), JP and Jesse cover two now pitches regarding Swift Package Manager.


### News and community

Languages & Runtime manager [Ted Kremenek](https://twitter.com/tkremenek) shared photos of some [new office decorations over at Swift HQ](https://twitter.com/tkremenek/status/977268865066450944). 🤖

[Chris Lattner](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm) announced [Swift for TensorFlow](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/swift/xtXCEvtDe5Q), bringing first-class language support for the machine learning framework. Aside from the post, you can also check out [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvxjVx3zfw4vA4cvlKogyLNN&v=Yze693W4MaU) from Chris and Richard Wei at the TensorFlow Dev Summit 2018.

[try! Swift San Jose](https://www.tryswift.co/events/2018/sanjose/) was announced, with a focus on Swift Evolution and all the other Swift open source projects.

### Commits and pull requests

[Greg Titus](https://github.com/gregomni) fixed a [compiler crash](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15488) that happened when a `case` statement had both `let` and `var` [bindings for the same name](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7261).

[Stephen Canon](https://github.com/stephentyrone) merged a change to how `description` and `debugDescription` [display floating-point values](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15474). A fascinating read into a fast and simple algorithm, and be sure to check out the chart showing the performance gains! 😍

[Karoy Lorentey](https://github.com/lorentey) merged his pull request to add [conditional conformance to `Hashable` in more standard library types](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15382). Optionals, arrays, dictionaries, and ranges (among other types) can now participate in [synthesized `Hashable` conformance](https://forums.swift.org/t/amendment-se-0143-conditional-conformance-add-hashable-conformance-to-std-lib-types/11401).

[Mark Lacey](https://github.com/rudkx) landed a change to [fix type checking going exponential](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/15419) for tuple literals. One fewer case of Xcode complaining that a type check took too long? ⏱

[Michael Ilseman](https://github.com/milseman) added the [new `SmallString` type to the standard library](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/14755). The type is supported on 64-bit architectures and offers optimizations specific for (you guessed it) small strings.


### Accepted proposals

[SE-0192](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0192-non-exhaustive-enums.md): _Non-Exhaustive Enums_ is [out of re-review and has been accepted with revisions](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0192-non-exhaustive-enums-review-2/11043/62).

This proposal introduces _frozen_ vs _non-frozen_ enumerations, and the final revisions add the new `@unknown` attribute.

[SE-0201](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0201-package-manager-local-dependencies.md): _Package Manager Local Dependencies_ by [Ankit Aggarwal](https://github.com/aciidb0mb3r) was [accepted](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0201-package-manager-local-dependencies/11629).

This proposal would allow you to declare a package dependency via a local path rather than a remote URL.


### Returned proposals

[SE-0200](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0200-raw-string-escaping.md): _"Raw" mode string literals_ by [John Holdsworth](https://github.com/johnno1962) was [returned for revision](https://forums.swift.org/t/returned-for-revision-se-0200-raw-mode-string-literals/11630).

This proposal had a ton of discussion in the thread. The two main reasons for returning the proposal for revision were:

> - The proposed `r"..."` syntax didn’t fit well with the rest of the language
> - The proposal itself leans heavily on regular expressions as a use case for raw string literals... a revised proposal will need additional motivating examples in other domains.


### Proposals in review

[SE-0202](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0202-random-unification.md): _Random Unification_ by [Alejandro Alonso](https://github.com/Azoy) is just out of review, [awaiting results](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0202-random-unification/11313).

This proposal adds `random()` static function to numeric types and collections, a `shuffled()` method to sequences, as well as a `shuffle()` method to mutable collections.


[SE-0203](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0203-rename-sequence-elements-equal.md): _Rename Sequence.elementsEqual_ is [in review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0203-rename-sequence-elementsequal/11482).

This proposal would remove a point of confusion where `==` and `elementsEqual` could return different results.

> Having surveyed alternative solutions to this problem, it is proposed that the method be renamed to `Sequence.elementsEqualInIterationOrder`.


[SE-0204](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0204-add-last-methods.md): _Add last(where:) and lastIndex(where:) Methods_ by Nate Cook is [in review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0204-add-last-where-and-lastindex-where-methods/11486).

We already have methods `first(where:)` and `index(where:)`, and this proposal would add similar methods to search from the end rather than from the beginning.


[SE-0206](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/78332d211d00abac286c47609ce1a88a03c6e9bf/proposals/0206-hashable-enhancements.md): _Hashable Enhancements_ by Karoy Lorentey and Vincent Esche is [in review until April 13](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0206-hashable-enhancements/11675).

> This proposal introduces a new `Hasher` type representing the standard library's universal hash function, and it extends the `Hashable` protocol with a new `hash(into:)` requirement that expresses hashing in terms of `Hasher`. [...] Standardizing on a single, high-quality hash function greatly improves the reliability of `Set` and `Dictionary`.


[Joe Groff]() [suggested a proposal to add `offset(of:)` to `MemoryLayout`](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/818/files?diff=unified).

> This proposal introduces the ability for Swift code to query the in-memory layout of stored properties in aggregates using key paths.
>
> `MemoryLayout<Rect>.offset(of: \.origin.x) // => 0`
> `MemoryLayout<Rect>.offset(of: \.origin.y) // => 8`


### Swift Forums

[Soroush Khanlou](https://twitter.com/khanlou) [pitched an addition to `Sequence`](https://forums.swift.org/t/count-where-on-sequence/11186) to provide `count(where:)`:

> While Swift’s Sequence models brings a lot of niceties that we didn’t have access to in Objective-C, like `map` and `filter`, there are other useful operations on Sequences that the standard library doesn’t support yet. I’d like to pitch one today: `count(where:)`, which counts the number of objects in a Sequence that passes some test.
>
> `[1, 2, 3, -1, -2].count(where: { $0 > 0 }) // => 3`


[Michael Ilseman]() wrote a pitch for [character and string properties](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-character-and-string-properties/11620). This would add support for some handy computed properties such as `isWhitespace` and `isAscii` on characters, and helper structs and methods on strings to split lines and words.

Why not reach into string and character properties and do all this yourself? Short answer: Unicode is hard.

> [There] is potential harm in developers reaching for these properties to solve common tasks without understanding their deep implications in Unicode. Whenever possible, we believe the best form of harm-reduction is providing more ergonomic APIs with more appropriate semantics for these common tasks.


### Finally

I can’t wait for `#error` and `#warning` to land in Swift 4.2, but in the meantime [at least there’s Swift support for `#lolcode`](https://github.com/CodaFi/swift/blob/72f19c9565ae7da1fe8bb7a4d02ff51cec9caa54/test/Interpreter/lolcode.swift). 😹
