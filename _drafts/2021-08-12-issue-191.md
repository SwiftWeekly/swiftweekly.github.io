### News and community

[Collin Donnell](https://twitter.com/collindonnell) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/collindonnell/status/1420950032669286402) that Swift is the only language I could find with over 100 keywords.

[Khawer Khaliq](https://twitter.com/khawerkhaliq) wrote [a blog post](https://khawerkhaliq.com/blog/swift-optional-chaining/) explaining the power of optional chaining in Swift.

[Antoine van der Lee](https://www.twitter.com/twannl) has [a great resourses](https://www.avanderlee.com/#h-swift-keywords) about Swift keywords.

[Ayman Fayez](https://aymanmoo.medium.com/) wrote [a post](https://aymanmoo.medium.com/copy-on-assignment-vs-copy-on-write-in-swift-c3016b343d06) about copy-on-assignment vs. copy-on-write in Swift.

### Proposals in review

[SSE-0320](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0320-codingkeyrepresentable.md): *Coding of non `String` / `Int` keyed `Dictionary` into a `KeyedContainer`* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0320-coding-of-non-string-int-keyed-dictionary-into-a-keyedcontainer/50903).

> The current conformance of Swift's `Dictionary` to the `Codable` protocols has a somewhat-surprising limitation in that dictionaries whose key type is not `String` or `Int` (values directly representable in `CodingKey` types) encode not as `KeyedContainer`s but as `UnkeyedContainer`s. This behavior has caused much confusion for users and I would like to offer a way to improve the situation.

### Swift Forums

[Cal Stephens](https://twitter.com/calstephens98) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/guard-capture-specifier-for-closure-capture-lists/50805) introducing a `guard` capture specifier for closure capture lists.

> In some classes of Swift programming, such as UI programming, closures are a predominant way to perform action handling and send event notifications between multiple objects. When passing closures between parent objects and their children, special care must be taken to avoid retain cycles.
>
> `weak` captures are often the preferred method to avoid retain cycles. In action handling and event notification closures, there is typically no work to perform if `self` (or other captured objects) no longer exist. Because of this, a large number of these closures simply `guard` that the weakly captured object still exists, and otherwise do nothing.

[Johannes Auer](https://forums.swift.org/u/jmjauer) started [a thread] about `AnyAsyncSequence` in Swift.

[Benjamin Driscoll](https://forums.swift.org/u/bdriscoll) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/structural-opaque-result-types/50998) to add structural opaque result types.

> An opaque result type may be used as the result type of a function, the type of a variable, or the result type of a subscript. In all cases, the opaque result type must be the entire type. This proposal recommends lifting that restriction and allowing opaque result types in "structural" positions.
> 
> We should allow opaque result types in structural positions in the result type of a function, the type of a variable, or the result type of a subscript.

[mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) [pitched a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-registry-service-publish-endpoint/51067) that would add a publish endpoint to the package registry service.

> A package registry is responsible for determining which package releases are made available to a consumer.
> 
> Currently, the availability of a package release is determined by an out-of-band process. For example, a registry may consult an index of public Swift packages and make releases available for each tag with a valid version number.
> 
> Having a standard endpoint for publishing a new release to a package registry would empower maintainers to distribute their software and promote interoperability across service providers.

[Nicholas Maccharoli](https://forums.swift.org/u/nicholas_maccharoli) [purposed](https://forums.swift.org/t/if-guard-shorthand-for-optional-unwrapping/51088) a shordhand solution for optional unwrapping.
