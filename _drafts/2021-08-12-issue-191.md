Haven’t you all noticed that the last two weeks were pretty low-key for the Swift community? I feel this lull before the storm as September is coming and we all know what this means. Folks are holding their breath, eager to find out news from Apple.

Personally, this time is quite challenging though as I am getting ready to take the stage at [360iDev conference](https://360idev.com/). Unfortunately, the US didn’t open the borders even for fully vaccinated people, so I’m participating online this time. But even despite I won’t be able to meet old friends and make new in person, I am truly looking forward to connecting with people and sharing my experience using Swift for rapid development. Let me know if you’re participating there, let’s meet up!

Also, for those of you who want to give back to community and support Swift Weekly Brief, we are open for [sponsors](https://swiftweeklybrief.com/sponsorship/).

### Starter tasks

> [SR-15026](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-15026) [Compiler] Fix-it for deprecated initializers removes the `.init` part from `self.init`

### News and community

[Collin Donnell](https://twitter.com/collindonnell) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/collindonnell/status/1420950032669286402) that Swift is the only language I could find with over 100 keywords.

[Khawer Khaliq](https://twitter.com/khawerkhaliq) wrote [a blog post](https://khawerkhaliq.com/blog/swift-optional-chaining/) explaining the power of optional chaining in Swift.

[Antoine van der Lee](https://www.twitter.com/twannl) has [a great resourses](https://www.avanderlee.com/#h-swift-keywords) about Swift keywords.

[Ayman Fayez](https://aymanmoo.medium.com/) wrote [a post](https://aymanmoo.medium.com/copy-on-assignment-vs-copy-on-write-in-swift-c3016b343d06) about copy-on-assignment vs. copy-on-write in Swift.

### Proposals in review

[SSE-0320](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0320-codingkeyrepresentable.md): *Coding of non `String` / `Int` keyed `Dictionary` into a `KeyedContainer`* is [under review](https://forums.swift.org/t/se-0320-coding-of-non-string-int-keyed-dictionary-into-a-keyedcontainer/50903).

> The current conformance of Swift's `Dictionary` to the `Codable` protocols has a somewhat-surprising limitation in that dictionaries whose key type is not `String` or `Int` (values directly representable in `CodingKey` types) encode not as `KeyedContainer`s but as `UnkeyedContainer`s. This behavior has caused much confusion for users and I would like to offer a way to improve the situation.

### Swift Forums

[Cal Stephens](https://twitter.com/calstephens98) pitched [a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/guard-capture-specifier-for-closure-capture-lists/50805) introducing a `guard` capture specifier for closure capture lists.

> In some classes of Swift programming, such as UI programming, closures are a predominant way to perform action handling and send event notifications between multiple objects. When passing closures between parent objects and their children, special care must be taken to avoid retain cycles.
>
> `weak` captures are often the preferred method to avoid retain cycles. In action handling and event notification closures, there is typically no work to perform if `self` (or other captured objects) no longer exist. Because of this, a large number of these closures simply `guard` that the weakly captured object still exists, and otherwise do nothing.

[Johannes Auer](https://forums.swift.org/u/jmjauer) started [a thread] about `AnyAsyncSequence` in Swift.

[Benjamin Driscoll](https://forums.swift.org/u/bdriscoll) pitched [an idea](https://forums.swift.org/t/structural-opaque-result-types/50998) to add structural opaque result types.

> An opaque result type may be used as the result type of a function, the type of a variable, or the result type of a subscript. In all cases, the opaque result type must be the entire type. This proposal recommends lifting that restriction and allowing opaque result types in "structural" positions.
> 
> We should allow opaque result types in structural positions in the result type of a function, the type of a variable, or the result type of a subscript.

[mattt](https://twitter.com/mattt) [pitched a proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-registry-service-publish-endpoint/51067) that would add a publish endpoint to the package registry service.

> A package registry is responsible for determining which package releases are made available to a consumer.
> 
> Currently, the availability of a package release is determined by an out-of-band process. For example, a registry may consult an index of public Swift packages and make releases available for each tag with a valid version number.
> 
> Having a standard endpoint for publishing a new release to a package registry would empower maintainers to distribute their software and promote interoperability across service providers.

[Nicholas Maccharoli](https://forums.swift.org/u/nicholas_maccharoli) [purposed](https://forums.swift.org/t/if-guard-shorthand-for-optional-unwrapping/51088) a shordhand solution for optional unwrapping.

[Vihan Bhargava](https://twitter.com/vihanbh) wrote an aweseome overview of the new `SortedDictionary` and `SortedSet` APIs bring brought to swift-collections.

> The Swift Collections package currently includes two data structures which maintain its members in a well-defined order: `OrderedSet` and `OrderedDictionary`. These types are useful in a variety of use-cases, as they enumerate their elements in insertion order. However, there also exist many situations where its desired to maintain elements in an order specified by a predefined comparator. For example, a common pattern in user interfaces is displaying a list with entries sorted in some order, such as in chronological order.
>
> Quick ad hoc implementations of sorted data structures can have many pitfalls. A naive implementation can devolve to quadratic performance. A smarter implementation using binary search is difficult to get correct and has subtle potential pitfalls. For this reason, there is natural place to provide high-performance, production-grade sorted data structures.
