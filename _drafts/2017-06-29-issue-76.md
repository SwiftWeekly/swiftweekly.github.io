It was a busy week on the main [apple/swift](https://github.com/apple/swift) repo. Here are some stats from GitHub Insights:

> Excluding merges, 42 authors have pushed 187 commits to master and 345 commits to all branches. On master, 397 files have changed and there have been 12,419 additions and 9,248 deletions.

It's great to see so much work being done so soon after WWDC. The core team and other contributors are making significant progress on the road to the offical Swift 4 launch.

iOS 11 beta 2, tvOS 11 beta 2, and Swift Playgrounds 2 beta 2 were all released. Download them [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/), and keep filing radars!

### Swift Unwrapped

In [Episode 17: Testing in Swift](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/70319), Jesse and JP discuss how Swift and its set of open source tools are tested to ensure that every release breaks as little as possible. ðŸ˜œ

### News and community

Greg Heo [wrote a post](https://swiftunboxed.com/stdlib/json-encoder-encodable/) that looks at how Swift Encoder and Encodable work. There's been a lot of open source activity relaed to this new feature, so understanding how it works will help when trying to digest related PRs.

Matt Godbolt's Compiler Explorer now [supports Swift](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/877991651548975104).

David Owens [released a preview](https://owensd.io/2017/06/02/apous-early-preview/) for an extension to Visual Studio Code that supports Swift.

The Swift backend for the Swift-Evolution app, [Evo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evolution-app/id1210898168?mt=8), is [now open source](https://twitter.com/swift_evolution/status/878322333471068160).

Steven Hepting [explains](https://twitter.com/stevenhepting/status/878339681485635585) how Swift's `sort()` method is optimized. Find the [source code here](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/02e2bd5380af69948d2324b936bfc61e1454d8ea/stdlib/public/core/Sort.swift.gyb#L232-L301).

[Learn Swift Queens](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-Swift-Queens-Meetup/) & [Learn Swift Portland](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-Swift-Portland/), just launched. That's 11 [Learn Swift {CITY}](https://wordpress.com/post/swiftcoders.org/178) meet ups wordwide! Which city will be next?

[Brisk, a macOS app for submitting radars](https://github.com/br1sk/brisk) released [verion 1.0](https://github.com/br1sk/brisk/releases/tag/1.0.0) and a quick [1.0.1 follow-up release](https://github.com/br1sk/brisk/releases/tag/1.0.1). Check out the release notes and keeping filing radars!

More [fallout](https://twitter.com/s1ddok/status/879406585939984386) from Tuplegate. This was interesting to me because [I use this exact same pattern](https://github.com/garricn/GGNObservable/blob/master/GGNObservable/Classes/Observable.swift#L53). As [Slava points out](https://twitter.com/slava_pestov/status/879446070190800896) in the thread, there's still [room for improvement](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160307/012299.html).

### Proposals in review

[SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md): *String Index Overhaul* is back [in review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170619/037653.html) after some revisions.

### Mailing lists

Erica Sadun [made a pitch](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170626/037730.html) for a `!!` operator, which she calls "Unwrap or Die".

Ben Cohen [made a pitch](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170626/037776.html) regarding `Substring` performance affordances.

Itai Ferber sent [a message on Swift-Evolution](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170619/037672.html) asking for feedback regarding [SE-0166](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0166-swift-archival-serialization.md) and [SE-0167](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0167-swift-encoders.md) and letting the community know that suggestions have already been implemented and will continue to be considered.

Robert Bennett made an [interesting pitch](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170619/037676.html) for declaring `let` in protocols. I didn't realize this problem existed.

### Finally

Taking can [sometimes](https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/878499165663240192) feel as good as giving.
