### Commits and pull requests

Itai Ferber merged a pull request that fixes [SR-5277](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-5277). This allows classes to share an Encoder/Decoder with its super class. For further explanation, check out this [thread](https://twitter.com/garricn/status/878426105585127425).

Dave Abrahams opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9806) that implements [SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md), the String index Overhaul (See below).

[SE-0180](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0180-string-index-overhaul.md): *String Index Overhaul* is back [in review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170619/037653.html) after some revisions. Accepted Rejected by print time?

### Mailing lists

Itai Ferber sent [a message on Swift-Evolution](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170619/037672.html) asking for feedback regarding [SE-0166](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0166-swift-archival-serialization.md) and [SE-0167](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0167-swift-encoders.md) and letting the community know that suggestions have already been implemented and will continue to be considered.

Robert Bennett made an [interesting pitch](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170619/037676.html) for declaring `let` in protocols. I didn't realize this problem existed.

### Finally

Taking can [sometimes](https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/878499165663240192) feel as good as giving.
