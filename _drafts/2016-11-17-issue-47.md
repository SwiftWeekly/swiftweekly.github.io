### Commits and pull requests

Jacob Bandes-Storch opened a [Pull Request](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/558) to mark proposals with ongoing implementation effort on the [Swift-Evolution site](http://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/).

**@jtbandes** fixed [a bunch](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5763) of [crashes](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5751) in swiftc.

**@practicalswift** also fixed [a swiftc crash](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5760) and identified [a lot](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20is%3Amerged%20author%3Apracticalswift%20swiftc%20) (!) of them. 😱

### Returned proposals

[SE-0145](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0145-package-manager-version-pinning.md): *Package Manager Version Pinning* will [return for revision](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20161107/028758.html).

> Thanks to everyone who participated in this review!
> 
> Based on the pretty universal negative feedback, we are going to reject this proposal as is, and take it back for another round of revisions.
> 
> Our revised plan is:
>
> 1. To introduce an "autopin" behavior to cover the problem Paul outlined where `pin --all` effectively needs to be "sticky" for any new dependencies which come into play.
>
> 2. To make auto pinning on by default, with an explicit mechanism for projects to opt out.
