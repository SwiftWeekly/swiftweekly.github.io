[SE-0145](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0145-package-manager-version-pinning.md): *Package Manager Version Pinning* will [return for revision](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20161107/028758.html).

> Thanks to everyone who participated in this review!
> 
> Based on the pretty universal negative feedback, we are going to reject this proposal as is, and take it back for another round of revisions.
> 
> Our revised plan is:
>
> 1. To introduce an "autopin" behavior to cover the problem Paul outlined where `pin --all` effectively needs to be "sticky" for any new dependencies which come into play.
>
> 2. To make auto pinning on by default, with an explicit mechanism for projects to opt out.
