### Starter tasks

- [SR-3174](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3174): The `#selector` keyword gets confused by local variable names. A simple fix for this is to search for selectors after popping out of the local scope.
- [SR-3175](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3175): The Swift "driver" is the command-line program that runs when you invoke `swift` or `swiftc` on the command line. Its primary responsibility is to divy up work into several subprocesses (in parallel where possible). If one of these subprocesses terminates due to an exception, it would be helpful if the driver printed the signal number.
- [SR-3207](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-3207): Compilers should provide helpful errors, but they should never crash. With a little bit of C++, you can prevent a crash when Swift imports Objective-C code with incorrect nullability attributes, and instead a surface an error: "hey buddy, you can't have a pointer be both `nonnull` *and* `nullable`."

### Commits and pull requests

Jacob Bandes-Storch opened a [Pull Request](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/558) to mark proposals with ongoing implementation effort on the [Swift-Evolution site](http://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/).

**@jtbandes** fixed [a bunch](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5763) of [crashes](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5751) in swiftc.

**@practicalswift** also fixed [a swiftc crash](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5760) and identified [a lot](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20is%3Amerged%20author%3Apracticalswift%20swiftc%20) (!) of them. 😱

### Returned proposals

[SE-0145](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0145-package-manager-version-pinning.md): *Package Manager Version Pinning* will [return for revision](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20161107/028758.html).

> Thanks to everyone who participated in this review!
> 
> Based on the pretty universal negative feedback, we are going to reject this proposal as is, and take it back for another round of revisions.
> 
> Our revised plan is:
>
> 1. To introduce an "autopin" behavior to cover the problem Paul outlined where `pin --all` effectively needs to be "sticky" for any new dependencies which come into play.
>
> 2. To make auto pinning on by default, with an explicit mechanism for projects to opt out.

Please don't [hold your breath](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20161114/028857.html) if you were expecting non-`@objc` optional methods in protocols. Chris Lattner:

> We discussed this extensively in the Swift 3 timeframe, and I believe that the consensus was “no”: optional requirements are considered an Objective-C compatibility feature.
> 
> I don’t recall all of the discussion, but a major one would have to be that it is highly redundant with other language features we already have, and makes the design space of Swift APIs more complicated. If Objective-C didn’t already have them, we would never consider adding them to our protocol model.

### Finally

[Functional Emoji](https://twitter.com/functionalemoji) is an 'artisinal bot' that posts funny statements using emoji and common FP statements like `map`, `reduce` and `filter`. Some gems include:

{% highlight swift %}
- [🍻,🍈,🍯].reduce(eat) => [💩]
- [6⃣,🕔,0⃣].reduce(sum) => [8⃣]
- [🇬🇹,🌍,🇻🇳].map(turn) => [🇭🇳,🌏,🇻🇳]
{% endhighlight %}
