### Swift Unwrapped

Episode 11: [Ownership Manifesto](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped/69191)

This week we dive into the Ownership manifesto and give a brief overview of the complex topic of memory ownership revisions currently underway.

### News and community

> TODO

### Commits and pull requests

Not only was [SE-0178](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0178-character-unicode-view.md) reviewed and accepted, but also already [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/9675) by Dave Abrahams! Can it get even more Swift?

### Accepted proposals

[SE-176](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0176-enforce-exclusive-access-to-memory.md): *Enforce Exclusive Access to Memory* was [accepted pending revision review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-May/000378.html).

> This proposal has been accepted with revisions. Feedback was strongly positive. Some participants raised concern about the overhead of dynamic checking. The core team shares this concern but feels that there will be adequate opportunities later to make pragmatic decisions about when to enable dynamic checking.
>
> Most of the proposal is accepted. An implementation issue has been discovered with the use of dynamic enforcement on inout parameters. The proposal implementors suggest adopting a stronger rule governing the use of non-escaping closures which will also allow Swift to make firm guarantees about the use of static enforcement when a variable does not escape. The core team tentatively supports this new rule but believes it is a substantial enough revision that it requires a separate review period.

[SE-0178](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0178-character-unicode-view.md): *Add `unicodeScalars` property to `Character`* was [reviewed](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-May/000377.html) and [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170515/036714.html).

> The `Character` element type of `String` is currently a black box that provides
little functionality besides comparison, literal construction, and to be used
as an argument to `String.init`.
>
> Many operations on `String` could be neatly/readably implemented as operations
on each character in the string, if `Character` exposed its scalars more
directly. Many useful things can be determined by examining the scalars in a
grapheme (for example is this an ASCII character?).

> The proposal is accepted without revision. The proposal was uncontentious both on swift-evolution and in the Core Team review.

### Proposals in review

[SE-0163](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0163-string-revision-1.md): *String Revision: Collection Conformance, C Interop, Transcoding* by Ben Cohen and Dave Abrahams is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-May/000376.html).

> This proposal is to implement a subset of the changes from the [Swift 4
String
Manifesto](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/StringManifesto.md).
>
> Specifically:
>
> * Make `String` conform to `BidirectionalCollection`
> * Make `String` conform to `RangeReplaceableCollection` 
> * Create a `Substring` type for `String.SubSequence`
> * Create a `StringProtocol` protocol to allow for generic operations over both types.
> * Consolidate on a concise set of C interop methods.
> * Revise the transcoding infrastructure.
> * Sink Unicode-specific functionality into a `Unicode` namespace.
>
> Other existing aspects of `String` remain unchanged for the purposes of this 
proposal.

As mentioned above, [SE-176](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0176-enforce-exclusive-access-to-memory.md): *Enforce Exclusive Access to Memory* was accepted pending revisions. A [new review period](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-May/000379.html) for only the revisions has started:

> Most of this proposal was previously accepted. An implementation issue has been discovered with the use of dynamic enforcement on inout parameters. The proposal implementors suggest adopting a stronger rule governing the use of non-escaping closures which will also allow Swift to make firm guarantees about the use of static enforcement when a variable does not escape. The core team tentatively supports this new rule but believes it is a substantial enough revision that it requires a separate review period.

[SE-0179](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0179-swift-run-command.md): *Swift `run` Command* by David Hart is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2017-May/000380.html).

> The proposal introduces a new `swift run` command to build and run an executable defined in the current package.
>
> It is common to want to build and run an executable during development. For now, one must first build it and then execute it from the build folder.
>
> To improve the development workflow, the proposal suggests introducing a new first-level `swift run` command that will build if necessary and then run an executable defined in the `Package.swift` manifest.
