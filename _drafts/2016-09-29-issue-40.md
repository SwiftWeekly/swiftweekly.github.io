### Proposals in review

Proposal [SE-0141](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0141-available-by-swift-version.md): *Availability by Swift version* from Graydon Hoare is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-September/000286.html).

> Swift's existing `@available(...)` attribute indicates the lifecycle of a given declaration, either unconditionally or relative to a particular platform or OS version range.
> 
> It does not currently support indicating declaration lifecycle relative to Swift language versions. This proposal seeks to extend it to do so.

Proposal [SE-0142](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0142-associated-types-constraints.md): *Permit where clauses to constrain associated types* from David Hart, Jacob Bandes-Storch and Doug Gregor is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-September/000287.html).

> This proposal seeks to introduce a `where` clause to associated type declarations and improvements to protocol constraints to bring associated types the same expressive power as generic type parameters.
