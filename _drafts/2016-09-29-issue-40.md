### Commits and pull requests

Shortly after it was featured in last week's brief, Erik Eckstein [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4927) a [bug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1901) that forced internal Foundation and XCTest symbols to be marked as `public`. Thanks to this, Brian Gesiak was able to [send](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/174) a pull request to correctly specify internal API in XCTest.

Joe Groff [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4933) the second half of [SE-0139](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0139-bridge-nsnumber-and-nsvalue.md) by bridging Swift numeric types to Objective-C `NSNumber`.

Andrew Trick [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4954) evolution proposal [SE-0138](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0138-unsaferawbufferpointer.md), adding `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` and `UnsafeRawMutableBufferPointer` to the standard library.

Brian Gesiak [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4972) a pull request that allows macOS host machines to compile the Swift runtime for Android. Previously only Linux machines could compile for Android.

Work continues to improve compiler diagnostics. Harlan Haskins [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4980) a pull request to prevent a compiler assertion when incorrectly using `var` for type-inferred parameters in closures, such as `takesClosure { (var d) in d }`. With Harlan's change, this now produces the error "parameters may not have the 'var' specifier". Mark Lacey [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4998) a pull request to fix this confusing error message:

{% highlight swift %}
func foo(x: Int, _ y: Int) -> Int {
  return x + y
}

func bar() -> Int {
  return foo(3, 5) // error: unnamed argument #2 must precede unnamed argument #1
}
{% endhighlight %}

Mark's work corrects the error message:

{% highlight swift %}
func bar() -> Int {
  return foo(3, 5) // error: missing argument label 'x' in call
}
{% endhighlight %}

Dave Abrahams [uploaded](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/3796) a work-in-progress pull request from Maxim Moiseev that implements [SE-0104](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0104-improved-integers.md), protocol-oriented integers. If you're curious what pull requests look like before they're ready to merge, take a look!

@lplarson [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4989) an option to the script used to build the Swift compiler that allows it to be built with [profile guided optimization](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#profile-guided-optimization). It'll be interesting to see whether this results in improved Swift compiler performance! And to learn how you can use this advanced Clang feature in your own applications, read Apple's [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/xcode_profile_guided_optimization/pgo-using/pgo-using.html).

Eli Perkins [sent](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4929) a pull request to mark `UnicodeScalar.utf16` and `UnicodeScalar.UTF16View` as `public`, completing one of the starter tasks introduced in last week's brief.

@damuellen [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4928) a badge to the Swift README that displays the build status of Swift on Ubuntu 16.04. Swift now runs on Ubuntu 14, 15, and 16.

### Proposals in review

Proposal [SE-0141](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0141-available-by-swift-version.md): *Availability by Swift version* from Graydon Hoare is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-September/000286.html).

> Swift's existing `@available(...)` attribute indicates the lifecycle of a given declaration, either unconditionally or relative to a particular platform or OS version range.
> 
> It does not currently support indicating declaration lifecycle relative to Swift language versions. This proposal seeks to extend it to do so.

Proposal [SE-0142](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0142-associated-types-constraints.md): *Permit where clauses to constrain associated types* from David Hart, Jacob Bandes-Storch and Doug Gregor is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-September/000287.html).

> This proposal seeks to introduce a `where` clause to associated type declarations and improvements to protocol constraints to bring associated types the same expressive power as generic type parameters.

### Mailing lists

> TODO

Brian Michel [proposed](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2741) adding options for the compiler to output structured information about compilation times.

### Finally

> TODO: something funny/fun. tweet, link, etc.
